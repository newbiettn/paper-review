abstract = {Background Various diabetes risk scores composed of non-laboratory parameters have been developed, but only a few studies performed cross-validation of these scores and a comparison with laboratory parameters. We evaluated the performance of diabetes risk scores composed of non-laboratory parameters, including a recently published Korean risk score (KRS), and compared them with laboratory parameters. Methods The data of 26,675 individuals who visited the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center for a health screening program were reviewed for cross-sectional validation. The data of 3,029 individuals with a mean of 6.2 years of follow-up were reviewed for longitudinal validation. The KRS and 16 other risk scores were evaluated and compared with a laboratory prediction model developed by logistic regression analysis. Results For the screening of undiagnosed diabetes, the KRS exhibited a sensitivity of 81{\%}, a specificity of 58{\%}, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) of 0.754. Other scores showed AROCs that ranged from 0.697 to 0.782. For the prediction of future diabetes, the KRS exhibited a sensitivity of 74{\%}, a specificity of 54{\%}, and an AROC of 0.696. Other scores had AROCs ranging from 0.630 to 0.721. The laboratory prediction model composed of fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels showed a significantly higher AROC (0.838, P {\textless} 0.001) than the KRS. The addition of the KRS to the laboratory prediction model increased the AROC (0.849, P = 0.016) without a significant improvement in the risk classification (net reclassification index: 4.6{\%}, P = 0.264). Conclusions The non-laboratory risk scores, including KRS, are useful to estimate the risk of undiagnosed diabetes but are inferior to the laboratory parameters for predicting future diabetes.},

The structure of this automatic system based on LDA-MWSVM for the diagnosis of diabetes is composed of three stages: The feature extraction and feature reduction stage by using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method and the classification stage by using Morlet Wavelet Support Vector Machine (MWSVM) classifier stage. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to separate features variables between healthy and patient (diabetes) data in the first stage. The healthy and patient (diabetes) features obtained in the first stage are given to inputs of the MWSVM classifier in the second stage. Finally, in the third stage, the correct diagnosis performance of this automatic system based on LDA-MWSVM for the diagnosis of diabetes is calculated by using sensitivity and specificity analysis, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix, respectively. The classification accuracy of this system was obtained at about 89.74{\%}. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Simulation of a glucoregulatory model with uncertainty in insulin sensitivities, glucose absorption and food intake is carried out using both methods. Interval simulation is superior in predicting all severe and mild hyper- and hypoglycemia episodes. Furthermore, much less computational time is required for interval simulation than for Monte Carlo simulation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {In this work, we constructed diabetes predictive models using electronic health record data, which could potentially have better preventive power than other diabetes predictive models known according to our knowledge. Diabetes is one of the most common, costly and complicated diseases all over the world, including China. To tackle the complexity of diabetes, electronic health record has been widely used to support physicians in integrated care. However, diabetes predictive models using electronic health record may lack of preventive power when the clinical measurements directly related to diabetes diagnosis criteria are used. To overcome this limitation, we did not use glucose, insulin, C-peptide and HbAIC clinical measurements in classifying diabetes patients. We used decision-table and support vector machine algorithm to build predictive models. As the result, our decision-table-based model achieves accuracy of 0.879, AUC of 0.921, precision of 0.898 and recall of 0.904, which is comparable with any known definition to diabetes. Our support-vector-machine-based model achieves accuracy of 0.660, AUC of 0.584, precision of 0.652 and recall of 0.939. We also found 37 measurements significantly associated to diabetes, which are not directly related to diabetes diagnosis criteria.},

abstract = {An increasing number of decision support systems based on domain knowledge are adopted to diagnose medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. It is widely pointed that the classical ontologies cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and knowledge problems with uncertainty. This paper presents a novel fuzzy expert system for diabetes decision support application. A five-layer fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to describe knowledge with uncertainty. By applying the novel fuzzy ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes ontology (FDO) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. Additionally, a semantic decision support agent (SDSA), including a knowledge construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. The knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and relations based on the structure of the FDO. The instances of the FDO are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. Finally, based on the FDO and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for diabetes-related application. Importantly, the proposed fuzzy expert system can work effectively for diabetes decision support application.},

abstract = {This paper describes a prediction algorithm for blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes. An iPhone application was developed that allows patients to record their daily blood glucose levels and provide them with relevant feedback using the prediction algorithm to help control their blood glucose levels. Several methods using theoretical functions were tested to select the most accurate prediction method. The prediction is adjusted with each glucose reading input by the patient taking into consideration the time of the glucose reading and the time after the patient's last meal, as well as any physical activity. The individualized prediction algorithm was tested and verified with real patient data and also validated using a non-parametric regression method. The accuracy of prediction results varied from different approaches and was adequate for most of the methods tested. The predicted results merged closer to the patients' actual glucose readings after each additional input reading. The findings of the research were encouraging and the predictive system provided what we believe to be helpful feedback to control, improve, and take proactive measures to regulate blood glucose levels. 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The global prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing. Studies support screening and interventions for pre-diabetes, which results in serious complications and diabetes. This study aimed at developing an intelligence-based screening model for pre-diabetes that could assist with decreasing the prevalence of diabetes through early identification and subsequent interventions. Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were used, excluding subjects with diabetes. The KNHANES 2010 data (n = 4,685) were used for training and internal validation, while data from KNHANES 2011 (n = 4,566) were used for external validation. We developed a model to screen for pre-diabetes using support vector machine (SVM), and performed a systematic evaluation of the SVM model using internal and external validation. We compared the performance of the SVM model with that of a screening score model based on logistic regression analysis for pre-diabetes that had been developed previously. Backward elimination logistic regression resulted in associations between pre-diabetes and age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, alcohol intake, family history of diabetes, and hypertension. The areas under the curves (AUCs) for the SVM model in the internal and external datasets were 0.761 and 0.731, respectively, while the AUCs for the screening score model were 0.734 and 0.712, respectively. The SVM model developed in this study performed better than the screening score model that had been developed previously and may be more effective for pre-diabetes screening.},

abstract = {We present CoLe, a model for cooperative agents for mining knowledge from heterogeneous data. CoLe allows for the cooperation of different mining agents and the combination of the mined knowledge into knowledge structures that no individual mining agent can produce alone. CoLe organizes the work in rounds so that knowledge discovered by one mining agent can help others in the next round. We implemented a multi-agent system based on CoLe for mining diabetes data, including an agent using a genetic algorithm for mining event sequences, an agent with improvements to the PART algorithm for our problem and a combination agent with methods to produce hybrid rules containing conjunctive and sequence conditions. In our experiments, the CoLe-based system outperformed the individual mining algorithms, with better rules and more rules of a certain quality. From the medical perspective, our system confirmed hypertension has a tight relation to diabetes, and it also suggested connections new to medical doctors.},

The physiological processes related to diabetes are simulated by compartmental models, which quantify the absorption of subcutaneously administered insulin, the absorption of glucose from the gut following a meal, as well as the effects of exercise on plasma glucose and insulin dynamics. In addition, Support Vector machines for Regression are employed to provide individualized predictions of the subcutaneous glucose concentrations.

abstract = {Data-driven techniques have recently drawn significant interest in the predictive modeling of subcutaneous (s.c.) glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes. In this study, the s.c. glucose prediction is treated as a multivariate regression problem, which is addressed using support vector regression (SVR). The proposed method is based on variables concerning: 1) the s.c. glucose profile; 2) the plasma insulin concentration; 3) the appearance of meal-derived glucose in the systemic circulation; and 4) the energy expenditure during physical activities. Six cases corresponding to different combinations of the aforementioned variables are used to investigate the influence of the input on the daily glucose prediction. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset of 27 patients in free-living conditions. Tenfold cross validation is applied to each dataset individually to both optimize and test the SVR model. In the case, where all the input variables are considered, the average prediction errors are 5.21, 6.03, 7.14, and 7.62 mg/dl for 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min prediction horizons, respectively. The results clearly indicate that the availability of multivariable data and their effective combination can significantly increase the accuracy of both short-term and long-term predictions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering. Glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes is a function of biological and environmental factors which present high inter-patient variability. The objective of this study is to evaluate a number of features, which are extracted from medical and lifestyle self-monitoring data, with respect to their ability to predict the short-term subcutaneous (s.c.) glucose concentration of an individual. Random forests (RF) and RReliefF algorithms are first employed to rank the candidate feature set. Then, a forward selection procedure follows to build a glucose predictive model, where features are sequentially added to it in decreasing order of importance. Predictions are performed using support vector regression or Gaussian processes. The proposed method is validated on a dataset of 15 type diabetics in real-life conditions. The s.c. glucose profile along with time of the day and plasma insulin concentration are systematically highly ranked, while the effect of food intake and physical activity varies considerably among patients. Moreover, the average prediction error converges in less than d/2 iterations (d is the number of features). Our results suggest that RF and RReliefF can find the most informative features and can be successfully used to customize the input of glucose models.},

abstract = {DIABNET is a knowledge-based system designed to aid doctors with therapy planning in gestational diabetes. The system core is a qualitative model, implemented by a Causal Probabilistic Network, that is able to detect the insulin effectiveness on a daily basis. DIABNET analyses monitoring data and proposes quantitative changes in insulin therapy and qualitative diet modifications. This paper proposes an evaluation methodology to assess the system performance when working in a real scenario. The methodology manages the absence of a gold standard and includes: a subjective analysis based on questionnaires and an objective analysis based on a quantitative comparison of the system's and experts' proposals. The paper also shows the results of two experiments in which expert diabetologists evaluated the therapeutical advice provided by DIABNET during the follow up of 9 patients with gestational diabetes. DIABNET detected the need of a therapy modification in 92{\%} of the cases showing its appropriateness for automatic alarm generation. Around 80{\%} of the proposals were accepted by experts. The evaluation results are encouraging and allow characterisation of the system's performance when proposing therapy modifications. Evaluation in its turn helps to refine the knowledge managed by DIABNET and enables us to look towards the further clinical use of DIABNET as a decision tool in gestational diabetes integrated in a telemedicine service.

abstract = {A nonlinear model predictive controller has been developed to maintain normoglycemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes during fasting conditions such as during overnight fast. The controller employs a compartment model, which represents the glucoregulatory system and includes submodels representing absorption of subcutaneously administered short-acting insulin Lispro and gut absorption. The controller uses Bayesian parameter estimation to determine time-varying model parameters. Moving target trajectory facilitates slow, controlled normalization of elevated glucose levels and faster normalization of low glucose values. The predictive capabilities of the model have been evaluated using data from 15 clinical experiments in subjects with type 1 diabetes. The experiments employed intravenous glucose sampling (every 15 min) and subcutaneous infusion of insulin Lispro by insulin pump (modified also every 15 min). The model gave glucose predictions with a mean square error proportionally related to the prediction horizon with the value of 0.2 mmol L(-1) per 15 min. The assessment of clinical utility of model-based glucose predictions using Clarke error grid analysis gave 95{\%} of values in zone A and the remaining 5{\%} of values in zone B for glucose predictions up to 60 min (n = 1674). In conclusion, adaptive nonlinear model predictive control is promising for the control of glucose concentration during fasting conditions in subjects with type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The early identification of subjects at high risk for diabetes is essential, thus, random rather than fasting plasma glucose is more useful. We aim to evaluate the time interval between pre-diabetes to diabetes with anti-diabetic drugs by using HbA1C as a diagnostic tool, and predicting it using a mathematic model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used the Taipei Medical University Affiliated Hospital Patient Profile Database (AHPPD) from January-2007 to June-2011. The patients who progressed and were prescribed anti-diabetic drugs were selected from AHPPD. The mathematical model used to predict the time interval of HbA1C value ranged from 5.7{\%} to 6.5{\%} for diabetes progression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We predicted an average overall time interval for all participants in between 5.7{\%} to 6.5{\%} during a total of 907 days (standard error, 103 days). For each group found among 5.7{\%} to 6.5{\%} we determined 1169.3 days for the low risk group (i.e. 3.2 years), 1080.5 days (i.e. 2.96 years) for the increased risk group and 729.4 days (i.e. 1.99 years) for the diabetes group. This indicates the patients will take an average of 2.49 years to reach 6.5{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This prediction model is very useful to help prioritize the diagnosis at an early stage for targeting individuals with risk of diabetes. Using patients' HbA1C before anti-diabetes drugs are used we predicted the time interval from pre-diabetes progression to diabetes is 2.49 years without any influence of age and gender. Additional studies are needed to support this model for a long term prediction.},

All but 21 women had results from follow-up at 1-2 years, while 84 women were lost from that point.

In simple regression analysis, using NGT at 1-2 years and at 5 years as the reference, diabetes at 1- to 2-year follow-up or later was clearly associated with easily assessable clinical variables, such as BMI at 1- to 2-year follow-up, 2-h OGTT glucose concentration during pregnancy, and non-European origin (P {\textless} 0.0001).

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on "Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare". BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and often undiagnosed condition for patients with diabetes. It is also a condition that significantly impacts healthcare outcomes, use, and cost as well as elevating suicide risk. Therefore, a model to predict depression among diabetes patients is a promising and valuable tool for providers to proactively assess depressive symptoms and identify those with depression. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to develop a generalized multilevel regression model, using a longitudinal data set from a recent large-scale clinical trial, to predict depression severity and presence of major depression among patients with diabetes. METHODS: Severity of depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 score. Predictors were selected from 29 candidate factors to develop a 2-level Poisson regression model that can make population-average predictions for all patients and subject-specific predictions for individual patients with historical records. Newly obtained patient records can be incorporated with historical records to update the prediction model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were used to evaluate predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores. The study also evaluated the classification ability of using the predicted PHQ-9 scores to classify patients as having major depression. RESULTS: Two time-invariant and 10 time-varying predictors were selected for the model. Incorporating historical records and using them to update the model may improve both predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores and classification ability of the predicted scores. Subject-specific predictions (for individual patients with historical records) achieved RMSE about 4 and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve about 0.9 and are better than population-average predictions. CONCLUSIONS: The study developed a generalized multilevel regression model to predict depression and demonstrated that using generalized multilevel regression based on longitudinal patient records can achieve high predictive ability.},

Due to having fuzzy input and output (glucose rate) values and because of that dependent variable have more than 2 values (unlike binary logic), ANFIS and Multinomial Logistic Regression should be executed for comparison. Then the results were benchmarked.

The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes (T2D) cases and controls for a GWAS, using data captured through routine clinical care across five institutions using different electronic medical record (EMR) systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results. The performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating institutions compared against clinician review. A GWAS was subsequently performed using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across all five institutions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The algorithm achieved 98{\%} and 100{\%} positive predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as compared against clinician review. By standardizing and applying the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified.

abstract = {AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and use of anti-diabetic medications for patients with GDM in Korea, using data of the period 2007-2011 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) database, which includes the claims data of 97{\%} of the Korean population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes provided by the HIRA to identify women with delivery in the HIRA database between 2009 and 2011. GDM was defined according to ICD-10 codes, and patients with pre-existing diabetes between January 1, 2007 and pregnancy were excluded. A Poisson regression was performed to evaluate the trends in annual prevalence rates. RESULTS: The annual numbers of deliveries in 2009-2011 were 479,160 in 2009, 449,747 in 2010, and 377,374 in 2011. The prevalence of GDM during that period was 7.5{\%} in 2009-2011: 5.7{\%} in 2009, 7.8{\%} in 2010, and 9.5{\%} in 2011. The age-stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of GDM was highest in women aged 40-44 years, at 10.6{\%} in 2009-2011, and that the annual prevalence significantly increased even in young women aged 20-29 years during that period (P {\textless} 0.05). More than 95{\%} of the patients with GDM did not take any anti-diabetic medication. Among the anti-diabetic medications prescribed for patients with GDM, insulin was most commonly prescribed (for {\textgreater}98{\%} of the patients with GDM on medication). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of GDM in Korean women recently reached 5.7-9.5{\%} in recent years. This represents a public health concern that warrants proper screening and medical care for GDM in women during the childbearing years.},

However, in current health examination systems, people get only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the data containing historical health records and personal life style information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be given to people for disease prevention. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes is very important for developing diabetes prediction tools instead of blood testing. Recently, many researches have studied risk factors of diabetes in order to apply them to be a tool for diabetes prediction by using Logistic Regression (LR), Radial Basis and Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN). However, the accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH, Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35{\%}, 83.5{\%}, 83.6{\%} and 83.65{\%}, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the baseline up to 1.2{\%}.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its related complications is raising the need for effective methods to predict patient evolution and for stratifying cohorts in terms of risk of developing diabetes-related complications. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the simulation of a type 1 diabetes population, based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks, which combines literature knowledge with data mining of a rich longitudinal cohort of type 1 diabetes patients, the DCCT/EDIC study. In particular, in our approach we simulate the patient health state and complications through discretized variables. Two types of models are presented, one entirely learned from the data and the other partially driven by literature derived knowledge. The whole cohort is simulated for fifteen years, and the simulation error (i.e. for each variable, the percentage of patients predicted in the wrong state) is calculated every year on independent test data. For each variable, the population predicted in the wrong state is below 10{\%} on both models over time. Furthermore, the distributions of real vs. simulated patients greatly overlap. Thus, the proposed models are viable tools to support decision making in type 1 diabetes.},

This project aims to help patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy achieve and maintain good blood glucose control. Over the course of seven years and three clinical research studies, a series of defining cases altered the research and development path. Each of these cases suggested a new, unanticipated research direction or clinical application. New AI technologies, including naive Bayes classification and support vector regression, were incorporated. New medical research into glycemic variability and blood glucose prediction was undertaken.

abstract = {Background Imputation techniques used to handle missing data are based on the principle of replacement. It is widely advocated that multiple imputation is superior to other imputation methods, however studies have suggested that simple methods for filling missing data can be just as accurate as complex methods. The objective of this study was to implement a number of simple and more complex imputation methods, and assess the effect of these techniques on the performance of undiagnosed diabetes risk prediction models during external validation. Methods Data from the Cape Town Bellville-South cohort served as the basis for this study. Imputation methods and models were identified via recent systematic reviews. Models' discrimination was assessed and compared using C-statistic and non-parametric methods, before and after recalibration through simple intercept adjustment. Results The study sample consisted of 1256 individuals, of whom 173 were excluded due to previously diagnosed diabetes. Of the final 1083 individuals, 329 (30.4{\%}) had missing data. Family history had the highest proportion of missing data (25{\%}). Imputation of the outcome, undiagnosed diabetes, was highest in stochastic regression imputation (163 individuals). Overall, deletion resulted in the lowest model performances while simple imputation yielded the highest C-statistic for the Cambridge Diabetes Risk model, Kuwaiti Risk model, Omani Diabetes Risk model and Rotterdam Predictive model. Multiple imputation only yielded the highest C-statistic for the Rotterdam Predictive model, which were matched by simpler imputation methods. Conclusions Deletion was confirmed as a poor technique for handling missing data. However, despite the emphasized disadvantages of simpler imputation methods, this study showed that implementing these methods results in similar predictive utility for undiagnosed diabetes when compared to multiple imputation.},

abstract = {In this paper two models for the simulation of glucose-insulin metabolism of children with Type 1 diabetes are presented. The models are based on the combined use of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks (NNs). Data from children with Type 1 diabetes, stored in a database, have been used as input to the models. The data are taken from four children with Type 1 diabetes and contain information about glucose levels taken from continuous glucose monitoring system, insulin intake and food intake, along with corresponding time. The influences of taken insulin on plasma insulin concentration, as well as the effect of food intake on glucose input into the blood from the gut, are estimated from the CMs. The outputs of CMs, along with previous glucose measurements, are fed to a NN, which provides short-term prediction of glucose values. For comparative reasons two different NN architectures have been tested: a Feed-Forward NN (FFNN) trained with the back-propagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate and momentum, and a Recurrent NN (RNN), trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The results indicate that the best prediction performance can be achieved by the use of RNN.},

abstract = {We propose a robust diabetes prediction model by examining how predictions from several learning algorithms, performing the same task, can be exploited to yield a higher performance than the best individual learning algorithm. The task was to forecast the onset of non-insulin dependent diabetes within a five year period using previous vital sign examination information. Experimental data is a 768 x 9 array arranged as row vectors, each with observed input in all but the last column which contains a single vector of output. Five well-known models were trained with associated learning algorithms (Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Radial Basis Function (RBF), C4.5, Naive Bayes and RIPPER) on the same dataset, and performance compared using Accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristics area (aROC) and Speed as metrics. After comparison, a combiner (Meta) model, using a simple Logistic Regression algorithm, was trained to make a final prediction using outputs of the best and worst performing algorithms (in the order Accuracy - aROC - Speed) as additional inputs. C4.5 had the best performance with Accuracy of 77.9{\%} and aROC of 83.1{\%}. The RBF gave the lowest performance with Accuracy of 73.6{\%} and aROC of 80.5{\%}. The Meta model achieved a classification accuracy of 77.0{\%} with aROC of 84.9{\%}. The slight decline in Accuracy was because we used aROC (not Accuracy) as the performance metric during selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes have increased risks of developing macro-vascular complications including heart disease and stroke; which are the leading causes of death globally. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes, and to investigate their predictors among adults ≥18 years in Florida.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data covering the time period January-December 2013, were obtained from Florida's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Survey design of the study was declared using SVYSET statement of STATA 13.1. Descriptive analyses were performed to estimate the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes. Predictors of pre-diabetes and diabetes were investigated using multinomial logistic regression model. Model goodness-of-fit was evaluated using both the multinomial goodness-of-fit test proposed by Fagerland, Hosmer, and Bofin, as well as, the Hosmer-Lemeshow's goodness of fit test.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were approximately 2,983 (7.3{\%}) and 5,189 (12.1{\%}) adults in Florida diagnosed with pre-diabetes and diabetes, respectively. Over half of the study respondents were white, married and over the age of 45 years while 36.4{\%} reported being physically inactive, overweight (36.4{\%}) or obese (26.4{\%}), hypertensive (34.6{\%}), hypercholesteremic (40.3{\%}), and 26{\%} were arthritic. Based on the final multivariable multinomial model, only being overweight (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR] = 1.85, 95{\%} Confidence Interval [95{\%} CI] = 1.41, 2.42), obese (RRR = 3.41, 95{\%} CI = 2.61, 4.45), hypertensive (RRR = 1.69, 95{\%} CI = 1.33, 2.15), hypercholesterolemic (RRR = 1.94, 95{\%} CI = 1.55, 2.43), and arthritic (RRR = 1.24, 95{\%} CI = 1.00, 1.55) had significant associations with pre-diabetes. However, more predictors had significant associations with diabetes and the strengths of associations tended to be higher than for the association with pre-diabetes. For instance, the relative risk ratios for the association between diabetes and being overweight (RRR = 2.00, 95{\%} CI = 1.55, 2.57), or obese (RRR = 4.04, 95{\%} CI = 3.22, 5.07), hypertensive (RRR = 2.66, 95{\%} CI = 2.08, 3.41), hypercholesterolemic (RRR = 1.98, 95{\%} CI = 1.61, 2.45) and arthritic (RRR = 1.28, 95{\%} CI = 1.04, 1.58) were all further away from the null than their associations with pre-diabetes. Moreover, a number of variables such as age, income level, sex, and level of physical activity had significant association with diabetes but not pre-diabetes. The risk of diabetes increased with increasing age, lower income, in males, and with physical inactivity. Insufficient physical activity had no significant association with the risk of diabetes or pre-diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of differences in the strength of association of the predictors across levels of diabetes status (pre-diabetes and diabetes) among adults ≥18 years in Florida. It is important to monitor populations at high risk for pre-diabetes and diabetes, so as to help guide health programming decisions and resource allocations to control the condition.},

abstract = {We evaluated a neural network model for prediction of glucose in critically ill trauma and post-operative cardiothoracic surgical patients. A prospective, feasibility trial evaluating a continuous glucose-monitoring device was performed. After institutional review board approval, clinical data from all consenting surgical intensive care unit patients were converted to an electronic format using novel software. This data was utilized to develop and train a neural network model for real-time prediction of serum glucose concentration implementing a prediction horizon of 75 minutes. Glycemic data from 19 patients were used to "train" the neural network model. Subsequent real-time simulated testing was performed in 5 patients to whom the neural network model was naive. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute difference percent (MAD{\%}), Clarke Error Grid Analysis, and calculation of the percent of hypoglycemic (≤70 mg/dL), normoglycemic ({\textgreater}70 and {\textless}150 mg/dL), and hyperglycemic (≥150 mg/dL) values accurately predicted by the model; 9,405 data points were analyzed. The models successfully predicted trends in glucose in the 5 test patients. Clark Error Grid Analysis indicated that 100.0{\%} of predictions were clinically acceptable with 87.3{\%} and 12.7{\%} of predicted values falling within regions A and B of the error grid respectively. Overall model error (MAD{\%}) was 9.0{\%} with respect to actual continuous glucose modeling data. Our model successfully predicted 96.7{\%} and 53.6{\%} of the normo- and hyperglycemic values respectively. No hypoglycemic events occurred in these patients. Use of neural network models for real-time prediction of glucose in the surgical intensive care unit setting offers healthcare providers potentially useful information which could facilitate optimization of glycemic control, patient safety, and improved care. Similar models can be implemented across a wider scale of biomedical variables to offer real-time optimization, training, and adaptation that increase predictive accuracy and performance of therapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer, and these two diseases are among the most common and important causes of morbidity and mortality in Taiwan.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To use data mining techniques to develop a model for predicting the development of liver cancer within 6 years of diagnosis with type II diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, which covers approximately 22 million people. In this study, we selected patients who were newly diagnosed with type II diabetes during the 2000-2003 periods, with no prior cancer diagnosis. We then used encrypted personal ID to perform data linkage with the cancer registry database to identify whether these patients were diagnosed with liver cancer. Finally, we identified 2060 cases and assigned them to a case group (patients diagnosed with liver cancer after diabetes) and a control group (patients with diabetes but no liver cancer). The risk factors were identified from the literature review and physicians' suggestion, then, chi-square test was conducted on each independent variable (or potential risk factor) for a comparison between patients with liver cancer and those without, those found to be significant were selected as the factors. We subsequently performed data training and testing to construct artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) prediction models. The dataset was randomly divided into 2 groups: a training group and a test group. The training group consisted of 1442 cases (70{\%} of the entire dataset), and the prediction model was developed on the basis of the training group. The remaining 30{\%} (618 cases) were assigned to the test group for model validation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The following 10 variables were used to develop the ANN and LR models: sex, age, alcoholic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, other types of chronic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease, other types of fatty liver disease, and hyperlipidemia. The performance of the ANN was superior to that of LR, according to the sensitivity (0.757), specificity (0.755), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.873). After developing the optimal prediction model, we base on this model to construct a web-based application system for liver cancer prediction, which can provide support to physicians during consults with diabetes patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In the original dataset (n=2060), 33{\%} of diabetes patients were diagnosed with liver cancer (n=515). After using 70{\%} of the original data to training the model and other 30{\%} for testing, the sensitivity and specificity of our model were 0.757 and 0.755, respectively; this means that 75.7{\%} of diabetes patients can be predicted correctly to receive a future liver cancer diagnosis, and 75.5{\%} can be predicted correctly to not be diagnosed with liver cancer. These results reveal that this model can be used as effective predictors of liver cancer for diabetes patients, after discussion with physicians; they also agreed that model can assist physicians to advise potential liver cancer patients and also helpful to decrease the future cost incurred upon cancer treatment.},

The most common physiological parameter to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction are heart rate (HR) and correct QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Based on physiological parameters, an intelligent diagnostics system, using the hybrid approach of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemia. The proposed ANFIS is characterized by adaptive neural network capabilities and the fuzzy inference system. To optimize the membership functions and adaptive network parameters, a global learning optimization algorithm called hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is used. For clinical study, 15 children with Type 1 diabetes volunteered for an overnight study. All the real data sets are collected from the Department of Health, Government of Western Australia. Several experiments were conducted with 5 patients each, for a training set (184 data points), a validation set (192 data points) and a testing set (153 data points), which are randomly selected. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method is found to be satisfactory by giving better sensitivity, 79.09{\%} and acceptable specificity, 51.82{\%}.},

abstract = {Among the many related issues of diabetes management, its complications constitute the main part of the heavy burden of this disease. The aim of this paper is to develop a risk advisor model to predict the chances of diabetes complications according to the changes in risk factors. As the starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n) their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated using the na{\"{i}}ve Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R2, F-ratio and adjusted R2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model using real patient data. The results suggest that the best fitted regression models outperform the predictive ability of an ANN model, as well as six other regression patterns for all 1-1 models.},

abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of combined cardiorespiratory fitness and waist-to-height ratio in the form of a fit-fat index on incident diabetes risk. Additionally, the independent predictive performance of cardiorespiratory fitness, waist-to-height ratio, and body mass index also were estimated and compared. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of 10,381 men who had a normal electrocardiogram and no history of major chronic disease at baseline from 1979 to 2005. Random survival forest models and traditional Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict diabetes at 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidence horizons. Results Overall, 4.8{\%} of the participants developed diabetes. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for incidence risk demonstrated good discrimination using random survival forest models across fitness and fatness measures; Cox models were poor to fair. The differences between fitness and fatness measures across horizons were clinically negligible. Smoothed random survival forest estimates demonstrated the impact of each fitness and fatness measure on incident diabetes was intuitive and graded. Conclusions Although fitness and fatness measures showed a similar discriminative ability in predicting incident diabetes, unique to the study was the ability of the fit-fat index to demonstrate a better indication of incident risk when compared to fitness or fatness alone. A single index combining cardiorespiratory fitness and waist-to-height ratio may be more useful because it can indicate improvements in either or both of the measures.},

abstract = {Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) is a chronic disease characterized by the inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient amounts of insulin. Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4-6 insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy being to maintain normoglycemia--i.e., a blood glucose level between 4-7 mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these injections, various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a therapy. Here, an attempt is made to show how system identification and control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be used in design of optimal insulin regimens. The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The insulin subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several black-box models and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed models were able to describe the system accurately in all aspects during all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics. Based on the estimated models, short-term blood glucose predictors for up to two-hour-ahead blood glucose prediction were investigated.},

abstract = {Classical paper-and-pencil based risk assessment questionnaires are often accompanied by the online versions of the questionnaire to reach a wider population. This study focuses on the loss, especially in risk estimation performance, that can be inflicted by direct transformation from the paper to online versions of risk estimation calculators by ignoring the possibilities of more complex and accurate calculations that can be performed using the online calculators. We empirically compare the risk estimation performance between four major diabetes risk calculators and two, more advanced, predictive models. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999-2012 was used to evaluate the performance of detecting diabetes and pre-diabetes. American Diabetes Association risk test achieved the best predictive performance in category of classical paper-and-pencil based tests with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.699 for undiagnosed diabetes (0.662 for pre-diabetes) and 47{\%} (47{\%} for pre-diabetes) persons selected for screening. Our results demonstrate a significant difference in performance with additional benefits for a lower number of persons selected for screening when statistical methods are used. The best AUC overall was obtained in diabetes risk prediction using logistic regression with AUC of 0.775 (0.734) and an average 34{\%} (48{\%}) persons selected for screening. However, generalized boosted regression models might be a better option from the economical point of view as the number of selected persons for screening of 30{\%} (47{\%}) lies significantly lower for diabetes risk assessment in comparison to logistic regression (p {\textless} 0.001), with a significantly higher AUC (p {\textless} 0.001) of 0.774 (0.740) for the pre-diabetes group. Our results demonstrate a serious lack of predictive performance in four major online diabetes risk calculators. Therefore, one should take great care and consider optimizing the online versions of questionnaires that were primarily developed as classical paper questionnaires.},

abstract = {In today's world the diabetes mellitus has become a major health problem among the people of all ages. Most of the researchers have proposed different systems to diagnose diabetes, in spite of which the accuracy of the prediction rate of diabetes is not so significant. Most of the techniques suggested were to detect diabetes associated with the parts of the body such as eye. heart or legs. All the developed systems aimed to identify diabetes by increasing the accuracy of the prediction rate but fail to do so in most of the cases as there were some issues that had not been discussed. The existing systems had number of drawbacks like some were only concentrated for women and who were less than 21 years old [5J, some gave greater accuracy if only one data set was used [6], some needed datasct of very good quality [12], some needed to standardize the ontology [10] and some even failed to show the performance of the developed systems [7] .So there is an need to develop a diabetes diagnosis system that improves the accuracy of the prediction rate by considering all the factors into account. This paper presents a novel approach for diagnosis of diabetes which has two stages to predict the diabetes status. The initial prediction stage adopts two computational intelligence and knowledge engineering techniques such as fuzzy logic (F), neural network (N) and case based reasoning (C) as an individual approach (FCN). The final prediction stage applies rule based algorithm to the values obtained from the initial stage. The benefit of applying these stages is that the accuracy of prediction rate will be higher when compared to using only the initial prediction stage done by most of the suggested systems for predicting the occurrence of diabetes mellitus. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Good blood glucose control is important to people with type 1 diabetes to prevent diabetes-related complications. Too much blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) causes long-term micro-vascular complications, while a severe drop in blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) can cause life-threatening coma. Finding the right balance between quantity and type of food intake, physical activity levels and insulin dosage, is a daily challenge. Increased physical activity levels often cause changes in blood glucose due to increased glucose uptake into tissues such as muscle. To date we have limited knowledge about the minute by minute effects of exercise on blood glucose levels, in part due to the difficulty in measuring glucose and physical activity levels continuously, in a free-living environment. By using a light and user-friendly armband we can record physical activity energy expenditure on a minute-by-minute basis. Simultaneously, by using a continuous glucose monitoring system we can record glucose concentrations. In this paper, Gaussian Processes are used to model the glucose excursions in response to physical activity data, to study its effect on glycaemic control.},

In the present study, we aimed to develop such risk scores, based on simple clinical variables. We studied a population-based cohort of 73,987 adults, aged 18 years and over. After 5.35 +/- 1.59 years of follow-up, 4,726 participants (9.58{\%}) in the exploration cohort developed type 2 diabetes and 2,327 participants (9.44{\%}) in the validation cohort developed type 2 diabetes. Age, gender, body mass index, family history of diabetes, education, blood pressure, and resting heart rate were selected to form the concise score with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.67. The variables in the concise score combined with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride (TG) or use of lipid-lowering drugs constituted the accurate score with an AUC value of 0.77. The utility of the two scores was confirmed in the validation cohort with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.77, respectively. In summary, the concise score, based on non-laboratory variables, could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes within Chinese population; the accurate score, which also uses FPG and TG data, is better at identifying such individuals.},

The proposed digital learning platform can log, analyze, predicate, and retrieve the learner behavior. The learner behavior sequence is logged and then analyzed using a sequence learning algorithm. When a new learner enter the platform, it is possible to predict the intention of the learner and thus provide the interested content to him immediately. The proposed architecture had been tested on the diabetes health education for 150 people. The experimental result showed that users were satisfied with the platform and the learning effect improved significantly. With the encouraging results, it will be feasible to apply proposed methodology to other learning courses for a better achievement of popular health.},

abstract = {Introduction. The objective of this study was to create a tool that accurately predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes according to an oral hypoglycemic agent. Materials and Methods. The model was based on a cohort of 33,067 patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a single oral hypoglycemic agent at the Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2006. Competing risk regression models were created for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and stroke, while a Cox regression model was created for mortality. Propensity scores were used to account for possible treatment bias. A prediction tool was created and internally validated using tenfold cross-validation. The results were compared to a Framingham model and a model based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) for CHD and stroke, respectively. Results and Discussion. Median follow-up for the mortality outcome was 769 days. The numbers of patients experiencing events were as follows: CHD (3062), heart failure (1408), stroke (1451), and mortality (3661). The prediction tools demonstrated the following concordance indices (c-statistics) for the specific outcomes: CHD (0.730), heart failure (0.753), stroke (0.688), and mortality (0.719). The prediction tool was superior to the Framingham model at predicting CHD and was at least as accurate as the UKPDS model at predicting stroke. Conclusions. We created an accurate tool for predicting the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and death in patients with type 2 diabetes. The calculator is available online at http://rcalc.ccf.org under the heading "Type 2 Diabetes" and entitled, "Predicting 5-Year Morbidity and Mortality." This may be a valuable tool to aid the clinician's choice of an oral hypoglycemic, to better inform patients, and to motivate dialogue between physician and patient.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) is re-emerging worldwide. Recently, the prevalence of DM is increasing in resource poor countries where TB is of high burden. The objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence and analyze associated factors of TB and DM comorbidity in South-Eastern Amhara Region, Ethiopia., METHODS: This was a facility based cross-sectional study. All newly diagnosed TB patients attending selected health facilities in the study area were consecutively screened for DM. DM was diagnosed based on the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, lifestyles and clinical data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with TB and DM comorbidity., RESULT: Among a total of 1314 patients who participated in the study, the prevalence of DM was estimated at 109 (8.3{\%}). Being female [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) (1.10-2.62)], patients age [41-64 years (OR 3.35; 95{\%} CI (2.01-5.57), 65-89 years (OR 3.18; 95{\%} CI (1.52-6.64)], being a pulmonary TB case [(OR 1.69; 95{\%} CI 1.09-2.63)] and having a family history of DM [(OR 4.54; 95{\%} CI (2.36-8.73)] were associated factors identified with TB and DM comorbidity., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DM among TB patients in South-Eastern Amahra Region is high. Routine screening of TB patients for DM is recommended in the study area.},

abstract = {The present work presents the comparative assessment of four glucose prediction models for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using data from sensors monitoring blood glucose concentration. The four models are based on a feedforward neural network (FNN), a self-organizing map (SOM), a neuro-fuzzy network with wavelets as activation functions (WFNN), and a linear regression model (LRM), respectively. For the development and evaluation of the models, data from 10 patients with T1DM for a 6-day observation period have been used. The models' predictive performance is evaluated considering a 30-, 60- and 120-min prediction horizon, using both mathematical and clinical criteria. Furthermore, the addition of input data from sensors monitoring physical activity is considered and its effect on the models' predictive performance is investigated. The continuous glucose-error grid analysis indicates that the models' predictive performance benefits mainly in the hypoglycemic range when additional information related to physical activity is fed into the models. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of SOM over FNN, WFNN, and LRM with SOM leading to better predictive performance in terms of both mathematical and clinical evaluation criteria.},

abstract = {Some global models to predict the risk of diabetes may not be applicable to local populations. We aimed to develop and validate a score to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural adult Chinese population. Data for a cohort of 12,849 participants were randomly divided into derivation (n = 11,564) and validation (n = 1285) datasets. A questionnaire interview and physical and blood biochemical examinations were performed at baseline (July to August 2007 and July to August 2008) and follow-up (July to August 2013 and July to October 2014). A Cox regression model was used to weigh each variable in the derivation dataset. For each significant variable, a score was calculated by multiplying beta by 100 and rounding to the nearest integer. Age, body mass index, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose (scores 3, 12, 24 and 76, respectively) were predictors of incident T2DM. The model accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with optimal cut-off value 936. With the derivation dataset, sensitivity, specificity and AUC of the model were 66.7{\%}, 74.0{\%} and 0.768 (95{\%} CI 0.760-0.776), respectively. With the validation dataset, the performance of the model was superior to the Chinese (simple), FINDRISC, Oman and IDRS models of T2DM risk but equivalent to the Framingham model, which is widely applicable in a variety of populations. Our model for predicting 6-year risk of T2DM could be used in a rural adult Chinese population.},

abstract = {The classical minimal model with single compartment was modified by the assumption that the insulin decay rate is not always a first-order process, and a mathematical function for describing the insulin infusion rate is introduced. The modified model was used to study four sets of published data including healthy humans and Type 2 diabetes with different types of insulin infusion rates. The single-step fitting process took the glucose-insulin system as a dynamic integrated physiological system and generated the real optimized model parameters from the experimental data using the modified model. It also avoided the errors from the interpolation or extrapolation for taking measured insulin points as inputs, which were mostly employed in publications when using the single or multi-compartments minimal model. The averaged R2 value between measured and calculated plasma concentrations for these four cases is 0.977, which indicates excellent agreement. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The specific causes of complex diseases such as Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have not yet been identified. Nevertheless, many medical science researchers believe that complex diseases are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Detection of such diseases becomes an issue because it is not free from false presumptions and is accompanied by unpredictable effects. Given the greatly increased amount of data gathered in medical databases, data mining has been used widely in recent years to detect and improve the diagnosis of complex diseases. However, past research showed that no single classifier can be considered optimal for all problems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on employing multiple classifier systems to improve the accuracy of detection for complex diseases, such as T2DM. We proposed a dynamic weighted voting scheme called multiple factors weighted combination for classifiers' decision combination. This method considers not only the local and global accuracy but also the diversity among classifiers and localized generalization error of each classifier. We evaluated our method on two real T2DM data sets and other medical data sets. The favorable results indicated that our proposed method significantly outperforms individual classifiers and other fusion methods.},
