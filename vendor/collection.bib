abstract = {The aim of this study was to design an expert system to predict the Non-Dipping or Dipping pattern by using several basic clinical and laboratory data through an artificial intelligence algorithm. Data Mining is a technique which extracts information from data sets by using a combination of both statistical analysis methods and artificial intelligence algorithms. Also in this study, the decision tree and naivebayes classification algorithms of this technique were used. Firstly, sixty-five patients (mean age 51{\&}{\#}x00B1;7 years, 40 females,) were included in the study. Systolic and diastolic dipping were found in 13 and 15 {\%} of the patients, respectively. In the advancing process of the experiment, the number of instances were reduced, because of some missing data of the patients. The data sets were tested using the J48 decision tree algorithm. This classification algorithm was implemented on 56 instances, and also the number of attributes was reduced from 35 to 23. 66 {\%} of the instances (37) were reserved for training and 44 {\%} of the instances (19) were reserved for testing. When the algorithm was run, the Non-Dipper/Dipper pattern of the instances were correctly predicted in a rate of 73.6842 {\%}. Model was built in 0.02 seconds. This pilot study shows that a machine learning algorithm can help in the prediction of diurnal blood pressure pattern relying on some basic demographic, clinical and laboratory data, with a reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {Diabetes, as the 4th death cause, has become a vital issue in the 21th century. However, blood sugar levels of most diabetic patients are not well controlled. For a patient with chronic disease, treatment efficiency could be influenced by the disease, remedy, and mental condition, in addition to his/her physiological status. Therefore, there is a great deal of difficulty in establishing a guideline to decide the reasonable dosage for a particular patient. To address this difficulty, this study, via team cooperation with the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Taichung Hospital, has designed an artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system may provide a real-time monitoring of patient¡¦s physical condition and adjust the insulin dosage from AI system to facilitate the monitoring, caring, and management of patients. Furthermore, abnormal condition may be detected earlier and then emergency treatment may be provided in time to prevent the occurrence of any unfortunate events caused by negligence. With this system, data of 4 patients was partitioned into training data set (3/2) and test data set (1/3). Training data set was entered into ANM system for an analysis of learning stage to build a prediction model for insulin dosage. Upon the completion, the test data set was tested with this prediction model for the accuracy of dosage control by bioartificial pancreas. Results showed that ANM system may effectively predict the occurrence of problems related to insulin dosage of bioartificial pancreas, with a satisfactory accuracy. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to present a hybrid approach based on the combined use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a nearest neighbours classifier for the selection of the critical clinical features which are strongly related with the incidence of fatal and non fatal Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). For the development and the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, data from the medical records of 560 patients with T2DM are used. The best subsets of features proposed by the implemented algorithm include the most common risk factors, such as age at diagnosis, duration of diagnosed diabetes, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol concentration, and smoking habit, but also factors related to the presence of other diabetes complications and the use of antihypertensive and diabetes treatment drugs (i.e. proteinuria, calcium antagonists, b-blockers, diguanides and insulin). The obtained results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved when the weighted k-nearest neighbours classifier was applied to the CVD dataset with the best subset of features selected by the GA, which resulted in high levels of accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.80) and specificity (0.98).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. We propose an online machine-learning solution to the problem of nonlinear glucose time series prediction in type 1 diabetes. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) has been proposed for training single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks. The high accuracy and fast learning speed of ELM drive us to investigate its applicability to the glucose prediction problem. Given that diabetes self-monitoring data are received sequentially, we focus on online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) and online sequential ELM kernels (KOS-ELM). A multivariate feature set is utilized concerning subcutaneous glucose, insulin therapy, carbohydrates intake and physical activity. The dataset comes from the continuous multi-day recordings of 15 type 1 patients in free-living conditions. Assuming stationarity and evaluating the performance of the proposed method by 10-fold cross- validation, KOS-ELM were found to perform better than OS-ELM in terms of prediction error, temporal gain and regularity of predictions for a 30-min prediction horizon.},

abstract = {Many diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are concerned about unstable blood glucose, even with regular monitoring by a family doctor. The insulin preparation shows peak action at several hours after subcutaneous administration. For this reason, unstable blood glucose is often caused by intensive insulin therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The insulin requirement is determined in proportion to fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the sliding scale method. A fixed amount of insulin is administered regardless of FBG level in the constant insulin method. It is indispensable to estimate FBG at peak time, when insulin works the hardest, to obtain the appropriate effect of insulin administration. We employed the local fuzzy reconstruction method based on chaos theory for predicting FBG at peak time. The direction to change the FBG at peak time is predicted with a 70-90{\%} success rate. The amount of insulin administration is adjusted based on predicted FBG level. After predictive glycemic control (PGC) for around one year, the FBG average approached the normal range, standard deviation (SD) reduced by half, and hyperglycemia decreased.},

abstract = {Diabetes is a condition requiring continuous everyday monitoring of health related tests. To monitor specific clinical complications one has to find a small set of features to be collected from the sensors and efficient resource-aware algorithms for their processing. This article is concerned with the detection and monitoring of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, CAN, in diabetes patients. Using a small set of features identified previously, we carry out an empirical investigation and comparison of several ensemble methods based on decision trees for a novel application of the processing of sensor data from diabetes patients for pervasive health monitoring of CAN. Our experiments relied on an extensive database collected by the Diabetes Complications Screening Research Initiative at Charles Sturt University and concentrated on the particular task of the detection and monitoring of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Most of the features in the database can now be collected using wearable sensors. Our experiments included several essential ensemble methods, a few more advanced and recent techniques, and a novel consensus function. The results show that our novel application of the decision trees in ensemble classifiers for the detection and monitoring of CAN in diabetes patients achieved better performance parameters compared with the outcomes obtained previously in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100{\%} which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90{\%} which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.},

Imprecise, vague and uncertain information is handled effectively to diagnose the Type-1 diabetes in an individual. Parameters like body mass index (bmi), plasma glucose level, minimum blood pressure and serum insulin level are used for the diagnosis based on the fuzzy logic, and the severity or probability of Type-1 diabetes is calculated. An insulin dosage (units/kg/day) is recommended by considering two attributes, i.e., plasma glucose level and bmi. Different levels of plasma glucose are captured on a daily basis to compute required dosage levels. Fuzzy logic tends to accurately calculate the probability to avoid any hypoglycemic condition in a diabetic. The final output is semantically arranged which depicts different parameters in terms of the fuzzy numbers like low, medium or high, and the probability of diagnosis in terms of five such fuzzy numbers like very low, low, medium, high or very high.

abstract = {Health examination has played an important role for maintaining people's health since it can not only help people understand their own health conditions clearly but also avoid missing the best timing of disease treatment. However, in current health examination systems, people get only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the data containing historical health records and personal life style information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be given to people for disease prevention. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

A Smartphone based system is developed that allows patients to monitor BG concentrations and report symptoms of illness and illness. Data gathered by patients through use of this device, will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in daily BG measurements can be used to predict illness in T1DM patients, before symptoms onset. A successful prediction model will enable patients to get early indication of upcoming illness, before they are bedridden. Patients can thus actively take precautions to avoid or shorten illness episodes or make these less severe and/or have healthy BG concentrations during illness. This project is breaking new grounds by detecting illness before the onset of symptoms and illness, and an illness prediction model using patient observable parameters will be an important advance in the field of disease surveillance and prediction.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is classified as Type 1 diabetes and it can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. Through the analysis of electrocar-diographic (ECG) signals of 15 children with T1DM, an effective hypoglycemia detection system, hybrid rough set based neural network (RNN) is developed by the use of physiological parameters of ECG signal. In order to detect the status of hypoglycemia, the feature of ECG of type 1 diabetics are extracted and classified according to corresponding glucose levels. In this technique, the applied physiological inputs are partitioned into predicted (certain) or random (uncertain) parts using defined lower and boundary of rough regions. In this way, the neural network is designed to deal only with the boundary region which mainly consists of a random part of applied input signal causing inaccurate modeling of the data set. A global training algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is introduced for parameter optimization of proposed RNN. The experiment is carried out using real data collected at Department of Health, Government of Western Australia. It indicated that the proposed hybrid architecture is efficient for hypoglycemia detection by achieving better sensitivity and specificity with less number of design parameters.},

abstract = {Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes is very important for developing diabetes prediction tools instead of blood testing. Recently, many researches have studied risk factors of diabetes in order to apply them to be a tool for diabetes prediction by using Logistic Regression (LR), Radial Basis and Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN). However, the accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH, Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35{\%}, 83.5{\%}, 83.6{\%} and 83.65{\%}, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the baseline up to 1.2{\%}.},

Here, data mining plays vital role in searching for patterns within huge clinical data that could provide useful basis of knowledge for efficient and effective decision-making. Classification mechanism is widely used tool of data mining employed in healthcare applications to facilitate disease diagnosis and prediction. Usually medical dataset are high dimension in nature containing many insignificant attributes or features and result poor classification with inaccuracies. Feature selection is a technique used for preprocessing the high-dimensional data to reduce data dimension and to remove redundant and irrelevant features. This paper provides a systematic data mining approach for selecting best indicators of diabetes among many attributes present in the database and gives an appropriate model to track the diabetes before its onset. It selects the most appropriate classifier model for the given dataset through voting mechanism to achieve best accuracy and eliminating any biased result.},

The proposed system is able to store a wealth of information regarding the clinical state of the T1DM patient and continuously provide the health experts with predictions regarding the possible future complications that he may present. The DSS is a hybrid infrastructure combining a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Rule Induction C5.0 classifier, with an improved Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network (iHWNN). A voting mechanism is utilized to merge the results from the four classification models. The proposed DSS has been trained and evaluated using data from 55 T1DM patients, acquired by the Athens Hippokration Hospital in close collaboration with the EURODIAB research team. The DSS has shown an excellent performance resulting in an accuracy of 98{\%}. Care has been taken to design and implement a consistent and continuously evolving Information Technology (IT) system by utilizing technologies such as smart agents periodically triggered to retrain the DSS with new cases added in the data repository.},

abstract = {Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) is a chronic disease characterized by the inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient amounts of insulin. Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4-6 insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy being to maintain normoglycemia--i.e., a blood glucose level between 4-7 mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these injections, various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a therapy. Here, an attempt is made to show how system identification and control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be used in design of optimal insulin regimens. The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The insulin subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several black-box models and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed models were able to describe the system accurately in all aspects during all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics. Based on the estimated models, short-term blood glucose predictors for up to two-hour-ahead blood glucose prediction were investigated.},

abstract = {It has been reported that concentrations of several biomarkers in diabetics' breath show significant difference from those in healthy people's breath. Concentrations of some biomarkers are also correlated with the blood glucose levels (BGLs) of diabetics. Therefore, it is possible to screen for diabetes and predict BGLs by analyzing one's breath. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel breath analysis system for this purpose. The system uses carefully selected chemical sensors to detect biomarkers in breath. Common interferential factors, including humidity and the ratio of alveolar air in breath, are compensated or handled in the algorithm. Considering the inter-subject variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction. 295 breath samples from healthy subjects and 279 samples from diabetic subjects were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The sensitivity and specificity of diabetes screening are 91.51{\%} and 90.77{\%}, respectively. The mean relative absolute error for BGL prediction is 21.7{\%}. Experiments show that the system is effective and that the strategies adopted in the system can improve its accuracy. The system potentially provides a noninvasive and convenient method for diabetes screening and BGL monitoring as an adjunct to the standard criteria.},
