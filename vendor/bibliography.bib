	Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is considered to be a severe health issue which is caused due to the presence of higher amount of plasma/glucose in the blood. A number of decision support systems were introduced to help medical experts for analyzing different factors that cause diabetes. Here a computerized information system is designed using Stacked Generalization for predicting diabetes. The classifiers under consideration are Decision Stump, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. The selection of Stacked Generalization is done after conducting a detail performance evaluation of individual classifiers and AdaBoost algorithm. The level of accuracy was varied from a lower value of 75 % to a higher value of 82 % by using Stacking algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic degenerative disease accepted as a worldwide epidemic. The diabetic foot is one of the most fearful complications of diabetic patients and is responsible for fifty percent of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations in general hospitals. Foot complications in diabetic patients can be prevented, in most of the cases, by submitting patients to continuous foot examinations and to a personal reeducation process. This paper describes an extension of SiSPED, a system to monitor patients with the possibility of developing the diabetic foot. In this extension the system has been entirely redesigned and new technologies are used to improve performance and maintainability. In addition, the rules applied to generate automatically a diagnostic report are updated to follow international guidelines applied in the diabetic foot prevention. The system also allows the correlation of patient data, essential to measure the impact of the methodology for diabetic foot prevention on the assisted population.},

@inproceedings{Luangruangrong2012Study-of-Type-2,
	Abstract = {Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes is very important for developing diabetes prediction tools instead of blood testing. Recently, many researches have studied risk factors of diabetes in order to apply them to be a tool for diabetes prediction by using Logistic Regression (LR), Radial Basis and Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN). However, the accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH, Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35%, 83.5%, 83.6% and 83.65%, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the baseline up to 1.2%.},

@inproceedings{Pavate2015Risk-Prediction,
	Abstract = {Diabetes has become the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries. By the endurance and hasty spread of diabetes, with increased number of ill condition, complications in the disease all over the world, several methodologies have been developed to predict and prevent this chronic disease. An early diagnosis of disease helps patients and medical experts to reduce the problem, risk and cost of medications. This paper presented an efficient system to predict diabetes and further complications with risk level. In this system, methods including genetic algorithm, nearest neighbor, and fuzzy rule-based system have been used in order to provide an accurate prediction system to prepare for presence of diabetes and complications. In this system, 235 individual's data were collected. The best subsets of features generated by the implemented algorithm include the most common risk factors such as age, family history, BMI, weight, smoking habit, alcohol habit and also factors related to the presence of other diabetes complications considered for predication of disease. The proposed system was prejudiced and the results showed to be more suitable by selecting best subset of features selected using variations of genetic algorithm depending on the types of nearest neighbor. The succeeded results produced 95.83% sensitivity, 95.50% accuracy and 86.95% specificity on impenetrable data which support the effectiveness of the system to predict the disease.},

@article{Zhao2015Rapid-Model-Ide,
	Abstract = {Goal: For conventional modeling methods, the work of model identification has to be repeated with sufficient data for each subject because different subjects may have different response to exogenous inputs. This may cause repetitive cost and burden for patients and clinicians and require a lot of modeling efforts. Here, to overcome the aforementioned problems, a rapid model development strategy for new subjects is proposed using the idea of model migration for online glucose prediction. Methods: First, a base model is obtained that can be empirically identified from any subject or constructed by a priori knowledge. Then, parameters of inputs in the base model are properly revised based on a small amount of new data from new subjects so that the updated models can reflect the specific glucose dynamics excited by inputs for new subjects. These problems are investigated by developing autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) based on 30 in silico subjects using UVA/Padova metabolic simulator. Results: The prediction accuracy of the rapid modeling method is comparable to that for subject-dependent modeling method for some cases. Also, it can present better generalization ability. Conclusion: The proposed method can be regarded as an effective and economic modeling method instead of repetitive subject-dependent modeling method especially for lack of modeling data.},

@article{Lee2014Prediction-of-F,
	Abstract = {It is well known that body fat distribution and obesity are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Prediction of type 2 diabetes using a combination of anthropometric measures remains a controversial issue. This study aims to predict the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) status that is used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a combination of various measures among Korean adults. A total of 4870 subjects (2955 females and 1915 males) participated in this study. Based on 37 anthropometric measures, we compared predictions of FPG status using individual versus combined measures using two machine-learning algorithms. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the predictions by logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier based on the combination of measures were 0.741 and 0.739 in females, respectively, and were 0.687 and 0.686 in males, respectively. Our results indicate that prediction of FPG status using a combination of anthropometric measures was superior to individual measures alone in both females and males. We show that using balanced data of normal and high FPG groups can improve the prediction and reduce the intrinsic bias of the model toward the majority class.},

	Abstract = {We propose an online machine-learning solution to the problem of nonlinear glucose time series prediction in type 1 diabetes. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) has been proposed for training single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks. The high accuracy and fast learning speed of ELM drive us to investigate its applicability to the glucose prediction problem. Given that diabetes self-monitoring data are received sequentially, we focus on online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) and online sequential ELM kernels (KOS-ELM). A multivariate feature set is utilized concerning subcutaneous glucose, insulin therapy, carbohydrates intake and physical activity. The dataset comes from the continuous multi-day recordings of 15 type 1 patients in free-living conditions. Assuming stationarity and evaluating the performance of the proposed method by 10-fold cross- validation, KOS-ELM were found to perform better than OS-ELM in terms of prediction error, temporal gain and regularity of predictions for a 30-min prediction horizon.},

	Abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is classified as Type 1 diabetes and it can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. Through the analysis of electrocar-diographic (ECG) signals of 15 children with T1DM, an effective hypoglycemia detection system, hybrid rough set based neural network (RNN) is developed by the use of physiological parameters of ECG signal. In order to detect the status of hypoglycemia, the feature of ECG of type 1 diabetics are extracted and classified according to corresponding glucose levels. In this technique, the applied physiological inputs are partitioned into predicted (certain) or random (uncertain) parts using defined lower and boundary of rough regions. In this way, the neural network is designed to deal only with the boundary region which mainly consists of a random part of applied input signal causing inaccurate modeling of the data set. A global training algorithm, hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is introduced for parameter optimization of proposed RNN. The experiment is carried out using real data collected at Department of Health, Government of Western Australia. It indicated that the proposed hybrid architecture is efficient for hypoglycemia detection by achieving better sensitivity and specificity with less number of design parameters.},

Here, data mining plays vital role in searching for patterns within huge clinical data that could provide useful basis of knowledge for efficient and effective decision-making. Classification mechanism is widely used tool of data mining employed in healthcare applications to facilitate disease diagnosis and prediction. Usually medical dataset are high dimension in nature containing many insignificant attributes or features and result poor classification with inaccuracies. Feature selection is a technique used for preprocessing the high-dimensional data to reduce data dimension and to remove redundant and irrelevant features. This paper provides a systematic data mining approach for selecting best indicators of diabetes among many attributes present in the database and gives an appropriate model to track the diabetes before its onset. It selects the most appropriate classifier model for the given dataset through voting mechanism to achieve best accuracy and eliminating any biased result.},

	Abstract = {There is an increasing number of diabetic diseases in the population. Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.},

Conventional neurofuzzy GMDH (NF-GMDH) uses radial basis network (RBF) as the partial descriptions. In this study the RBF partial descriptions are replaced with two input ANFIS structures and backpropagation algorithm is chosen for learning this network structure. The Prima Indians diabetes data set is used as training and testing sets which consist of 768 data whereby 268 of them are diagnosed with diabetes. The result of this study will provide solutions to the medical staff in determining whether someone is the diabetes sufferer or not which is much easier rather than currently doing a blood test. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the other models such as multi layer perceptron (MLP), RBF and ANFIS structure.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a fuzzy based expert system to handle the dynamics of diabetes diagnosis and its medication. Imprecise, vague and uncertain information is handled effectively to diagnose the Type-1 diabetes in an individual. Parameters like body mass index (bmi), plasma glucose level, minimum blood pressure and serum insulin level are used for the diagnosis based on the fuzzy logic, and the severity or probability of Type-1 diabetes is calculated. An insulin dosage (units/kg/day) is recommended by considering two attributes, i.e., plasma glucose level and bmi. Different levels of plasma glucose are captured on a daily basis to compute required dosage levels. Fuzzy logic tends to accurately calculate the probability to avoid any hypoglycemic condition in a diabetic. The final output is semantically arranged which depicts different parameters in terms of the fuzzy numbers like low, medium or high, and the probability of diagnosis in terms of five such fuzzy numbers like very low, low, medium, high or very high. This expert system can be effectively used for Type-1 diabetes diagnosis.},

	Abstract = {BackgroundVarious diabetes risk scores composed of non-laboratory parameters have been developed, but only a few studies performed cross-validation of these scores and a comparison with laboratory parameters. We evaluated the performance of diabetes risk scores composed of non-laboratory parameters, including a recently published Korean risk score (KRS), and compared them with laboratory parameters.MethodsThe data of 26,675 individuals who visited the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center for a health screening program were reviewed for cross-sectional validation. The data of 3,029 individuals with a mean of 6.2 years of follow-up were reviewed for longitudinal validation. The KRS and 16 other risk scores were evaluated and compared with a laboratory prediction model developed by logistic regression analysis.ResultsFor the screening of undiagnosed diabetes, the KRS exhibited a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 58%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) of 0.754. Other scores showed AROCs that ranged from 0.697 to 0.782. For the prediction of future diabetes, the KRS exhibited a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 54%, and an AROC of 0.696. Other scores had AROCs ranging from 0.630 to 0.721. The laboratory prediction model composed of fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels showed a significantly higher AROC (0.838, P&lt; 0.001) than the KRS. The addition of the KRS to the laboratory prediction model increased the AROC (0.849, P= 0.016) without a significant improvement in the risk classification (net reclassification index: 4.6%, P= 0.264).ConclusionsThe non-laboratory risk scores, including KRS, are useful to estimate the risk of undiagnosed diabetes but are inferior to the laboratory parameters for predicting future diabetes.},

	Abstract = {Diabetes, as the 4th death cause, has become a vital issue in the 21th century. However, blood sugar levels of most diabetic patients are not well controlled. For a patient with chronic disease, treatment efficiency could be influenced by the disease, remedy, and mental condition, in addition to his/her physiological status. Therefore, there is a great deal of difficulty in establishing a guideline to decide the reasonable dosage for a particular patient. To address this difficulty, this study, via team cooperation with the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Taichung Hospital, has designed an artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system may provide a real-time monitoring of patient's physical condition and adjust the insulin dosage from AI system to facilitate the monitoring, caring, and management of patients. Furthermore, abnormal condition may be detected earlier and then emergency treatment may be provided in time to prevent the occurrence of any unfortunate events caused by negligence. With this system, data of 4 patients was partitioned into training data set (3/2) and test data set (1/3). Training data set was entered into ANM system for an analysis of learning stage to build a prediction model for insulin dosage. Upon the completion, the test data set was tested with this prediction model for the accuracy of dosage control by bioartificial pancreas. Results showed that ANM system may effectively predict the occurrence of problems related to insulin dosage of bioartificial pancreas, with a satisfactory accuracy.},

To monitor specific clinical complications one has to find a small set of features to be collected from the sensors and efficient resource-aware algorithms for their processing.

Using a small set of features identified previously, we carry out an empirical investigation and comparison of several ensemble methods based on decision trees for a novel application of the processing of sensor data from diabetes patients for pervasive health monitoring of CAN. Our experiments relied on an extensive database collected by the Diabetes Complications Screening Research Initiative at Charles Sturt University and concentrated on the particular task of the detection and monitoring of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Most of the features in the database can now be collected using wearable sensors. Our experiments included several essential ensemble methods, a few more advanced and recent techniques, and a novel consensus function. The results show that our novel application of the decision trees in ensemble classifiers for the detection and monitoring of CAN in diabetes patients achieved better performance parameters compared with the outcomes obtained previously in the literature.},

However, in current health examination systems, people get only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the data containing historical health records and personal life style information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be given to people for disease prevention.},

	Abstract = {It has been reported that concentrations of several biomarkers in diabetics' breath show significant difference from those in healthy people's breath. Concentrations of some biomarkers are also correlated with the blood glucose levels (BGLs) of diabetics. Therefore, it is possible to screen for diabetes and predict BGLs by analyzing one's breath. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel breath analysis system for this purpose. The system uses carefully selected chemical sensors to detect biomarkers in breath. Common interferential factors, including humidity and the ratio of alveolar air in breath, are compensated or handled in the algorithm. Considering the intersubject variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction. A total of 295 breath samples from healthy subjects and 279 samples from diabetic subjects were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The sensitivity and specificity of diabetes screening are 91.51% and 90.77%, respectively. The mean relative absolute error for BGL prediction is 21.7%. Experiments show that the system is effective and that the strategies adopted in the system can improve its accuracy. The system potentially provides a noninvasive and convenient method for diabetes screening and BGL monitoring as an adjunct to the standard criteria.},

A number of researches have focused either in using one of the algorithms or in the comparisons of the performances of algorithms on a given, usually predefined and static datasets that are accessible through the Internet. This paper focuses on the joint implementation of the support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes statistical modeling, in the dataset acquired from the medical examinations of 402 patients, in order to improve the computer-supported diagnosis reliability. The dataset contains some attributes that have not been previously used in computer-based evaluations. The results show that the joint implementation of two algorithms improves significantly the overall reliability of the system outcome, which is crucial in the computer-supported diabetes diagnostic process.},

For managing such large amount of data, an efficient knowledge discovery process is required. This field is developing fast and there is a big scope of early planning towards the treatment of large number of diseases. The planning can be done by developing some strategic solutions based on Data Mining for the treatment of the disease. Classification based on supervised learning is a technique of Data Mining which helps in predicting the label of unknown samples as Class. This is extremely popular technique of Data Mining by which the treatment of a disease could be planned at an early stage. Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases produces metabolism disorder in human bodies. Metabolism refers a chemical process in human body responsible for energy conversion and utilization. The diabetes with type 1 and type 2 indicates excess glucose level in the blood could be cured if regular precautions have been taken persistently under certain clinical guidelines. This paper performs classification on diabetes dataset taken from SGPGI, Lucknow (A super specialty hospital in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India). It predicts an unknown class label for given set of data and helpful to find out whether the class label for the dataset under consideration would be of low risk, medium risk or high risk. The classifier is further trained on the basis of weights assigned to different attributes which are generated by means of expert guidelines. The accuracy of classifier is verified by kappa statistics and accuracy, evolution criteria for classifiers.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to design an expert system to predict the Non-Dipping or Dipping pattern by using several basic clinical and laboratory data through an artificial intelligence algorithm. Data Mining is a technique which extracts information from data sets by using a combination of both statistical analysis methods and artificial intelligence algorithms. Also in this study, the decision tree and naivebayes classification algorithms of this technique were used. Firstly, sixty-five patients (mean age 51$\pm$7 years, 40 females,) were included in the study. Systolic and diastolic dipping were found in 13 and 15 % of the patients, respectively. In the advancing process of the experiment, the number of instances were reduced, because of some missing data of the patients. The data sets were tested using the J48 decision tree algorithm. This classification algorithm was implemented on 56 instances, and also the number of attributes was reduced from 35 to 23. 66 % of the instances (37) were reserved for training and 44 % of the instances (19) were reserved for testing. When the algorithm was run, the Non-Dipper/Dipper pattern of the instances were correctly predicted in a rate of 73.6842 %. Model was built in 0.02 seconds. This pilot study shows that a machine learning algorithm can help in the prediction of diurnal blood pressure pattern relying on some basic demographic, clinical and laboratory data, with a reasonable accuracy.},

For the development and the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, data from the medical records of 560 patients with T2DM are used. The best subsets of features proposed by the implemented algorithm include the most common risk factors, such as age at diagnosis, duration of diagnosed diabetes, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol concentration, and smoking habit, but also factors related to the presence of other diabetes complications and the use of antihypertensive and diabetes treatment drugs (i.e. proteinuria, calcium antagonists, b-blockers, diguanides and insulin). The obtained results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved when the weighted k-nearest neighbours classifier was applied to the CVD dataset with the best subset of features selected by the GA, which resulted in high levels of accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.80) and specificity (0.98).},

	Abstract = {Data mining when applied on medical diagnosis can help doctors to take major decisions. Diabetes is a disease which has to be monitored by the patient so as not to cause severe damage to the body. Therefore to predict diabetes is an important task that is most important for the patient. In this study, a new data smoothening technique is proposed for noise removal from the data. It is very important for the user to have control over the smoothening of the data so that the information loss can be monitored. The proposed method allows the user to control the level of data smoothening by accepting the loss percentage on the individual data points. Allowable loss is calculated and a decision is made to smoothen the value or retain it to the level which is accurate. The proposed method will enable the user to get the output based on his requirements of preprocessing. The proposed algorithm will allow the user to interact with the data preprocessing system unlike the primitive algorithms. Different levels of smoothened output are obtained by different loss percentage. This preprocessed output produced will be of a better quality and will resemble more to the real world data. Furthermore, correlation and multiple regression is applied on the preprocessed diabetes dataset and a prediction is made on this basis.},
