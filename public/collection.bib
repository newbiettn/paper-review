Title = {{Self Care Behavior among Patients with Diabetes in Harari, Eastern
   Ethiopia: The Health Belief Model Perspective}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires
   lifelong medical treatments and a life style adjustment. To prevent
   serious morbidity and mortality, it requires dedication to demanding
   self-care behaviors in multiple domains. The objective of this study was
   to identify predictors of self care behaviors among patients with
   diabetes.
   Methods: From a total of 425 follow up diabetic patients, a quantitative
   cross sectional study was conducted among 222 of them from three
   different hospitals in Harar town, from March to April, 2011. The sample
   was taken using simple random sampling method. Data was collected using
   pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics multiple logistic
   regression analysis were also used to assess the predicators of self
   care behaviors among patients with diabetes.
   Result: Majority of the study respondents 134 (60.4\%) were female and
   the mean age was 49.7 (SD +/- 14.7) years. More than half 147(66.2\%) of
   them were medically diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. 208(93.7\%) had
   general knowledge about diabetes and specific knowledge about diabetes
   self care 207(93.2\%). Large proportion of them had moderate perceived
   susceptibility 174(78.4\%) and severity 112(50.5\%). More than half of
   the respondents 149(67.1\%) had less perceived barrier while only 30
   (13.5\%) of them had high self efficacy to self care practices related
   to diabetes mellitus. Only 87(39.2\%) followed the recommended self care
   practices on diabetes.
   Conclusions: Patients with less frequent information were less likely to
   take diabetes self care. Patients who were more educated, middle income,
   had high perceived severity of diabetes and less perceived barrier to
   self care were more likely to take diabetes self care. To increase the
   self care behavior, diabetes messages should focus on severity of
   diabetes and how to overcome barriers for self care by segmenting the
   audiences based on income and educational status with increasing the
   frequency and reach of message on diabetes.}},

Title = {{Genetic Variants of IDE-KIF11-HHEX at 10q23.33 Associated with Type 2
   Diabetes Risk: A Fine-Mapping Study in Chinese Population}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in populations of
   European ancestry have mapped a type 2 diabetes susceptibility region to
   chromosome 10q23.33 containing IDE, KIF11 and HHEX genes
   (IDE-KIF11-HHEX), which has also been replicated in Chinese populations.
   However, the functional relevance for genetic variants at this locus is
   still unclear. It is critical to systematically assess the relationship
   of genetic variants in this region with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A fine-mapping study was conducted by
   genotyping fourteen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a
   290-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) region using a two-stage case-control
   study of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population. Suggestive
   associations (P<0.05) observed from 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls in
   the first stage were further replicated in 1,725 cases and 2,081
   controls in the second stage. Seven tagging SNPs were consistently
   associated with type 2 diabetes in both stages (P<0.05), with combined
   odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.14 to 1.33 in the combined analysis.
   The most significant locus was rs7923837 {[}OR = 1.33, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 1.21-1.47] at the 3'-flanking region of HHEX gene. SNP
   rs1111875 was found to be another partially independent locus (OR =
   1.23, 95\% CI: 1.13-1.35) in this region that was associated with type 2
   diabetes risk. A cumulative effect of rs7923837 and rs1111875 was
   observed with individuals carrying 1, 2, and 3 or 4 risk alleles having
   a 1.27, 1.44, and 1.73-fold increased risk, respectively, for type 2
   diabetes (P for trend = 4.1E-10).
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results confirm that genetic variants of
   the IDE-KIF11-HHEX region at 10q23.33 contribute to type 2 diabetes
   susceptibility and suggest that rs7923837 may represent the strongest
   signal related to type 2 diabetes risk in the Chinese Han population.}},

Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Leukocyte telomere length (TL) is considered a biomarker for biological
   aging. Shortened TL has been observed in many complex diseases,
   including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Lifestyle intervention studies, e. g.
   the Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), have shown a decrease in the
   incidence of T2DM by promoting healthy lifestyles in individuals with
   impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Our aim was to study in the DPS the
   influence of the lifestyle intervention on TL. TL was measured by
   quantitative PCR-based method at two time points (N = 334 and 343) on
   average 4.5 years apart during the active intervention and
   post-intervention follow-up. TL inversely correlated with age. Our main
   finding was that TL increased in about two thirds of the individuals
   both in the intervention and in the control groups during follow-up; TL
   increased most in individuals with the shortest TL at the first
   measurement. TL was not associated with development of T2DM, nor did
   lifestyle intervention have an effect on TL. No association between
   insulin secretion or insulin resistance indices and TL was observed. We
   did not detect an association between TL and development of T2DM in the
   DPS participants. It could be due to all participants being overweight
   and having IGT at baseline, both of which have been found to be
   independently associated with shorter leukocyte TL in some earlier
   studies. TL had no substantial role in worsening of glucose tolerance in
   people with IGT. Our study confirms that leukocyte TL can increase with
   time even in obese people with impaired glucose metabolism.}},

   Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Disruption of endogenous circadian rhythms has been shown to
   increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, suggesting that
   circadian genes might play a role in determining disease susceptibility.
   We present the results of a pilot study investigating the association
   between type 2 diabetes and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in/near nine circadian genes. The variants were chosen based on
   their previously reported association with prostate cancer, a disease
   that has been suggested to have a genetic link with type 2 diabetes
   through a number of shared inherited risk determinants.
   Methodology/Principal Findings:The pilot study was performed using two
   genetically homogeneous Punjabi cohorts, one resident in the United
   Kingdom and one indigenous to Pakistan. Subjects with (N = 1732) and
   without (N = 1780) type 2 diabetes were genotyped for thirteen circadian
   variants using a competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
   method. Associations between the SNPs and type 2 diabetes were
   investigated using logistic regression. The results were also combined
   with in silico data from other South Asian datasets (SAT2D consortium)
   and white European cohorts (DIAGRAM+) using meta-analysis. The
   rs7602358G allele near PER2 was negatively associated with type 2
   diabetes in our Punjabi cohorts (combined odds ratio {[}OR]= 0.75
   {[}0.66-0.86], p = 3.18 x 10(-5)), while the BMAL1 rs11022775T allele
   was associated with an increased risk of the disease (combined OR = 1.22
   {[}1.07-1.39], p = 0.003). Neither of these associations was replicated
   in the SAT2D or DIAGRAM+ datasets, however. Meta-analysis of all the
   cohorts identified disease associations with two variants, rs2292912 in
   CRY2 and rs12315175 near CRY1, although statistical significance was
   nominal (combined OR 1.05 {[}1.01-1.08], p = 0.008 and OR = 0.95
   {[}0.91-0.99], p = 0.015 respectively).
   Conclusions/significance: None of the selected circadian gene variants
   was associated with type 2 diabetes with study-wide significance after
   meta-analysis. The nominal association observed with the CRY2 SNP,
   however, complements previous findings and confirms a role for this
   locus in disease susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adherence to prescribed medications is a key dimension of
   healthcare quality. The aim of this large population-based study was to
   evaluate self-reported medication adherence and to identify factors
   linked with poor adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes in France.
   Methodology: The ENTRED study 2007, a French national survey of people
   treated for diabetes, was based on a representative sample of patients
   who claimed reimbursement for oral hypoglycaemic agents and/or insulin
   at least three times between August 2006 and July 2007, and who were
   randomly selected from the database of the two main National Health
   Insurance Systems. Medication adherence was determined using a six-item
   self-administered questionnaire. A multinomial polychotomous logistic
   regression model was used to identify factors associated with medication
   adherence in the 3,637 persons with type 2 diabetes.
   Principal Findings: Thirty nine percent of patients reported good
   medication adherence, 49\% medium adherence and 12\% poor adherence. The
   factors significantly associated with poor adherence in multivariate
   analysis were socio-demographic factors: age <45 years, non-European
   geographical origin, financial difficulties and being professionally
   active; disease and therapy-related factors: HbA(1c) > 8\% and existing
   diabetes complications; and health care-related factors: difficulties
   for taking medication alone, decision making by the patient only, poor
   acceptability of medical recommendations, lack of family or social
   support, need for information on treatment, reporting no confidence in
   the future, need for medical support and follow-up by a specialist
   physician.
   Conclusions: In a country with a high level of access to healthcare, our
   study demonstrated a substantial low level of medication adherence in
   type 2 diabetic patients. Better identification of those with poor
   adherence and individualised suitable recommendations remain essential
   for better healthcare management.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require high
   specificity and large numbers of subjects to identify genotype-phenotype
   correlations accurately. The aim of this study was to identify type 2
   diabetes (T2D) cases and controls for a GWAS, using data captured
   through routine clinical care across five institutions using different
   electronic medical record (EMR) systems.
   Materials and Methods An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases
   and controls based on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and
   laboratory results. The performance of the algorithm was validated at
   three of the five participating institutions compared against clinician
   review. A GWAS was subsequently performed using cases and controls
   identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across all five
   institutions.
   Results The algorithm achieved 98\% and 100\% positive predictive values
   for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as
   compared against clinician review. By standardizing and applying the
   algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were
   identified. Subsequent GWAS using data from five institutions replicated
   the TCF7L2 gene variant (rs7903146) previously associated with T2D.
   Discussion By applying stringent criteria to EMR data collected through
   routine clinical care, cases and controls for a GWAS were identified
   that subsequently replicated a known genetic variant. The use of
   standard terminologies to define data elements enabled pooling of
   subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the
   robust numbers required for GWAS.
   Conclusions An algorithm using commonly available data from five
   different EMR can accurately identify T2D cases and controls for genetic

Abstract = {{Objective: The effect of smoking cessation on the risk of diabetes has
   been reported previously. However, it is unknown whether the association
   is influenced by weight gain and other potential risk factors.
   Methods: The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study
   established in 1990 for Cohort I and in 1993 for Cohort II provided
   data, and 25,875 men and 33,959 women were analyzed. The response rate
   to the baseline questionnaire was 80.9\%, and 68.4\% of the respondents
   participated both the 5- and 10-year follow-up surveys. Smoking
   cessation was noted during the initial five years and the development of
   diabetes was reported in the subsequent five years.
   Results: An increased risk was observed among individuals who newly quit
   smoking compared with never smokers among men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42,
   95\% CI = 1.03-1.94) and women (OR = 2.84, CI = 1.53-5.29). The risk of
   developing diabetes among male new quitters who gained 3 kg or more
   during the 5-year follow-up did not substantially differ from the risk
   among male never smokers with less than 3 kg of weight gain or no weight
   gain, while an increased risk was observed among male new quitters with
   less or no weight gain (OR = 1.46, 95\% CI 1.00-2.14). An insignificant
   increased risk was observed among male new quitters with a family
   history of diabetes compared with male never smokers with a family
   history of diabetes. The risk was more than twice as high for male new
   quitters who used to smoke 25 or more cigarettes per day compared with
   never smokers (OR = 2.15, 95\% CI: 1.34-3.47).
   Discussion: An increased risk of diabetes was implied among individuals
   who quit smoking. However, the increased risk was not implied among
   those who gained weight over the 5-years of follow-up. Those who had
   major risk factors for diabetes or who smoked heavier had a higher risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of the study was to determine predictors that
   influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a large cohort of
   elderly diabetes patients from primary care over a follow-up period of
   five years.
   Methods and Results: At the baseline measurement of the ESTHER cohort
   study (2000-2002), 1375 out of 9953 participants suffered from diabetes
   (13.8\%). 1057 of these diabetes patients responded to the second-follow
   up (2005-2007). HRQOL at baseline and follow-up was measured using the
   SF-12; mental component scores (MCS) and physical component scores (PCS)
   were calculated; multiple linear regression models were used to
   determine predictors of HRQOL at follow-up. As possible predictors for
   HRQOL, the following baseline variables were examined: treatment with
   insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), number of diabetes related
   complications, number of comorbid diseases, Body-Mass-Index (BMI),
   depression and HRQOL. Regression analyses were adjusted for
   sociodemographic variables and smoking status. 1034 patients (97.8\%)
   responded to the SF-12 both at baseline and after five years and were
   therefore included in the study. Regression analyses indicated that
   significant predictors of decreased MCS were a lower HRQOL, a higher
   number of diabetes related complications and a reported history of
   depression at baseline. Complications, BMI, smoking and HRQOL at
   baseline significantly predicted PCS at the five year follow-up.
   Conclusions: Our findings expand evidence from previous cross-sectional
   data indicating that in elderly diabetes patients, depression, diabetes
   related complications, smoking and BMI are temporally predictive for
   HRQOL.}},

   unexplored, especially in Asian population.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study, in which 140
   incident PD patients with diabetes were recruited. Patients were divided
   into tertiles according to the means of quarterly HbA1C levels measured
   during the first year after starting PD. We examined the association
   between HbA1C and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards
   models.
   Results: The mean age was 58.7 years, 59.3\% were male, and the mean
   follow-up duration was 3.5 years (range 0.4-9.5 years). The mean HbA1C
   levels were 6.3\%, 7.1\%, and 8.5\% in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertiles,
   respectively. Compared to the 1st tertile, the all-cause mortality rates
   were higher in the 2nd {[}hazard ratio (HR), 4.16; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI), 0.91-18.94; p = 0.065] and significantly higher in the
   3rd (HR, 13.16; 95\% CI, 2.67-64.92; p = 0.002) tertiles (p for trend =
   0.005), after adjusting for confounding factors. Cardiovascular
   mortality, however, did not differ significantly among the tertiles (p
   for trend = 0.682). In contrast, non-cardiovascular deaths, most of
   which were caused by infection, were more frequent in the 2nd (HR, 7.67;
   95\% CI, 0.68-86.37; p = 0.099) and the 3rd (HR, 51.24; 95\% CI,
   3.85-681.35; p = 0.003) tertiles than the 1st tertile (p for trend =
   0.007).
   Conclusions: Poor glycemic control is associated with high mortality
   rates in diabetic PD patients, suggesting that better glycemic control
   may improve the outcomes of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes is very important for developing
   diabetes prediction tools instead of blood testing. Recently, many
   researches have studied risk factors of diabetes in order to apply them
   to be a tool for diabetes prediction by using Logistic Regression (LR),
   Radial Basis and Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN). However, the
   accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking
   and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some
   traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and
   waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to
   extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes
   prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai
   people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train
   the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH,
   Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of
   accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35\%, 83.5\%, 83.6\% and
   83.65\%, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural
   network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden
   nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter
   i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and
   tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the
   baseline up to 1.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{In today's world the diabetes mellitus has become a major health problem
   among the people of all ages. Most of the researchers have proposed
   different systems to diagnose diabetes, in spite of which the accuracy
   of the prediction rate of diabetes is not so significant. Most of the
   techniques suggested were to detect diabetes associated with the parts
   of the body such as eye, heart or legs. All the developed systems aimed
   to identify diabetes by increasing the accuracy of the prediction rate
   but fail to do so in most of the cases as there were some issues that
   had not been discussed. The existing systems had number of drawbacks
   like some were only concentrated for women and who were less than 21
   years old {[}5], some gave greater accuracy if only one data set was
   used {[}6], some needed dataset of very good quality {[}12], some needed
   to standardize the ontology {[}10] and some even failed to show the
   performance of the developed systems {[}7]. So there is an need to
   develop a diabetes diagnosis system that improves the accuracy of the
   prediction rate by considering all the factors into account. This paper
   presents a novel approach for diagnosis of diabetes which has two stages
   to predict the diabetes status. The initial prediction stage adopts two
   computational intelligence and knowledge engineering techniques such as
   fuzzy logic (F), neural network (N) and case based reasoning (C) as an
   individual approach (FCN). The final prediction stage applies rule based
   algorithm to the values obtained from the initial stage. The benefit of
   applying these stages is that the accuracy of prediction rate will be
   higher when compared to using only the initial prediction stage done by
   most of the suggested systems for predicting the occurrence of diabetes
   mellitus. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or

Abstract = {{Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, is the most common complication
   experienced by Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. It is dangerous
   and can result in unconsciousness, seizures and even death. The most
   common physiological parameter to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction
   are heart rate (HR) and correct QT interval (QTc) of the
   electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Based on physiological parameters, an
   intelligent diagnostics system, using the hybrid approach of adaptive
   neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is developed to recognize the
   presence of hypoglycemia. The proposed ANFIS is characterized by
   adaptive neural network capabilities and the fuzzy inference system. To
   optimize the membership functions and adaptive network parameters, a
   global learning optimization algorithm called hybrid particle swarm
   optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is used. For clinical study,
   15 children with Type 1 diabetes volunteered for an overnight study. All
   the real data sets are collected from the Department of Health,
   Government of Western Australia. Several experiments were conducted with
   5 patients each, for a training set (184 data points), a validation set
   (192 data points) and a testing set (153 data points), which are
   randomly selected. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method is
   found to be satisfactory by giving better sensitivity, 79.09\% and
   acceptable specificity, 51.82\%.}},

Abstract = {{Health examination has played an important role for maintaining people's
   health since it can not only help people understand their own health
   conditions clearly but also avoid missing the best timing of disease
   treatment. However, in current health examination systems, people get
   only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced
   health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an
   effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the
   data containing historical health records and personal life style
   information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease
   status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk
   patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted
   early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also
   proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our
   method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy,
   precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In
   particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of
   life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for
   risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our
   mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease
   related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be
   given to people for disease prevention.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
   complex diseases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a challenge because of
   the low statistical power of individual markers from a genome-wide
   association study (GWAS). SNP combinations are suggested to compensate
   for the low statistical power of individual markers, but SNP
   combinations from GWAS generate high computational complexity. Hence, we
   aim to detect T2D causal SNP combinations from a GWAS dataset with
   optimal filtration and to discover the biological meaning of the
   detected SNP combinations. Optimal filtration can enhance the
   statistical power of SNP combinations by comparing the error rates of
   SNP combinations from various Bonferroni thresholds and p-value
   range-based thresholds combined with linkage disequilibrium (LD)
   pruning. T2D causal SNP combinations are selected using random forests
   with variable selection from an optimal SNP dataset. The selected SNPs
   with SNP combinations are mapped with multi-dimensional levels of
   T2D-related information and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A T2D
   causal SNP combination containing 101 SNPs from the Wellcome Trust Case
   Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS dataset are selected, with an error rate
   of 10.25\%. Matching with known disease genes and gene sets revealed the
   relationships between T2D and SNP combinations. We propose a detection
   method for complex disease causal SNP combinations from an optimal SNP
   dataset by using random forests with variable selection. Mapping the
   biological meanings of detected SNP combinations can help uncover
   complex disease mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes, which ranks 4th among the top ten causes of death in Taiwan,
   is one of the most important medical issues in the 21st century.
   However, for most diabetic patients, their blood sugar is not under good
   control, especially in ICUs. Good control of blood sugar may reduce the
   risk of sepsis to 34\% for patients in ICUs. The importance of good
   blood sugar control for patients in ICUs is manifested by a significant
   reduction of mortality and morbidity. This study designed a clinical
   decision support system (CDSS) using a support vector machine (SVM) to
   predict if a critically ill patient can have good glucose control after
   insulin administration. A filter method based on logistic regression
   analysis (LRA) and a wrapper method based on recursive feature
   elimination (RFE) were adopted to select salient features from 10
   variables for CDSS design. Data on 231 patients (2492 records) were
   collected covering four years from an ICU. Four significant variables (p
   < 0.05) using LRA in contrast to five ones using RFE algorithm, were
   selected. The results show that the predictive accuracy under
   cross-validation was 93.50\% for features selected with LRA, and the
   accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with SVM-RFE were 95.75\%, 92.71\%
   and 99.81\%, respectively. It could predict the outcome quite accurately
   after having injected a certain dose of insulin. The proposed system may
   help doctors effectively assess their patients in determining insulin
   dose for better glucose control in an ICU setting.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There are few opportunities to study the use of integrated
   electronic health record (EHR) systems, where single patient records are
   used by a number of health care staff. The purpose of the study was to
   understand how an integrated electronic health record system was used by
   health care staff in the treatment and management of diabetes patients.
   The investigation was focused on the interface between the primary and
   secondary care services which patients access for their diabetes care.
   Methods: Observations of the use of an integrated electronic health
   record during patients' consultations with health care staff were
   conducted over a three month period. Twelve patients were followed
   through their consultations with a range of health care staff at a
   secondary care Diabetes Centre and in primary care settings. A thematic

   Results: The integrated electronic health record system had been
   implemented across the primary and secondary care interface and was used
   by many, but not all, clinicians involved in the care of patients with
   diabetes. In some areas of care it enabled health care staff to access
   more accurate and detailed information to inform their clinical
   decision-making. Issues including negotiating rules for accessing
   patient records and duplication of recording in paper record systems had
   not been resolved consistently across services.
   Conclusions: The findings offer suggestive evidence that a shared
   electronic health record can support more integrated care. Unresolved
   issues in implementing the system across all services and settings
   highlight the governance problems that can arise when systems are
   developed locally but are then extended across organisational and
   professional boundaries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A noninvasive breath analysis system for diabetes diagnosis is proposed
   in this paper. It utilizes commercial chemical sensors to detect acetone
   in human breath. The device is portable, fast and easy to operate.
   Experiments with real breath samples from both inpatient and outpatient
   diabetics validated the accuracy of this system. An optimal sensor array
   for diabetes diagnosis is decided according to the classification
   accuracy. We hope this system could contribute a step toward a practical
   system that could be used for diabetes screening.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We prospectively examined whether socioeconomic status (SES)
   predicts incident type II diabetes (diabetes), a cardiovascular risk
   equivalent and burgeoning public health epidemic among women.
   Methods: Participants include 23,992 women with Hb(A1c) levels <6\% and
   no CVD or diabetes at baseline followed from February 1993 to March
   2007. SES was measured by education and income while diabetes was
   self-reported.
   Results: Over 12.3 years of follow-up, 1,262 women developed diabetes.
   In age and race adjusted models, the relative risk of diabetes decreased
   with increasing education (<2 years of nursing, 2 to <4 years of
   nursing, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate: 1.0, 0.7

   for traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors
   attenuated this relationship (education: p(trend)=0.96). Similar
   associations were observed between income categories and diabetes.
   Conclusion: Advanced education and increasing income were both inversely
   associated with incident diabetes even in this relatively well-educated
   cohort. This relationship was largely explained by behavioral factors,

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Diabetic dyslipidaemia is common in type 2 diabetes
   (T2D) and insulin resistance and often precedes the onset of T2D. The
   Taq1B polymorphism in CETP (B1 and B2 alleles) (rs708272) and the G-250A
   polymorphism in LIPC (rs2070895) are associated with changes in enzyme
   activity and lipid concentrations. Our aim was to assess the effects of
   both polymorphisms on the risk of T2D.
   Methods and Results: In a case-control study from the population-based
   Telde cohort, both polymorphisms were analysed by PCR-based methods.
   Subjects were classified, according to an oral glucose tolerance test,
   into diabetic (N = 115) and pre-diabetic (N = 116); 226 subjects with
   normal glucose tolerance, matched for age and gender, were included as
   controls. Chi-square (comparison between groups) and logistic regression
   (identification of independent effects) were used for analysis. The B1B1
   Taq1B CETP genotype frequency increased with worsening glucose
   metabolism (42.5\%, 46.1\% and 54.3\% in control, IGR and diabetic
   group; p = 0.042). This polymorphism was independently associated with
   an increased risk of diabetes (OR: 1.828; IC 95\%: 1.12-2.99; p =
   0.016), even after adjusting by confounding variables, whereas the LIPC
   polymorphism was not. Regarding the interaction between both
   polymorphisms, in the B1B1 genotype carriers, the absence of the minor
   (A) allele of the LIPC polymorphism increased the risk of having
   diabetes.
   Conclusion: The presence of the B1B1 Taq1B CETP genotype contributes to
   the presence of diabetes, independently of age, sex, BMI and waist.
   However, among carriers of B1B1, the presence of GG genotype of the -250
   LIPC polymorphism increases this risk further.}},

Title = {{Gut Microbiome Metagenomics Analysis Suggests a Functional Model for the
   Development of Autoimmunity for Type 1 Diabetes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested a bacterial role in the development of
   autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over 30 billion
   nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from
   stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control
   subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated
   autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one
   million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED
   protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples,
   144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls,
   respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions,
   motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses
   were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein
   metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more
   common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and
   flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering
   a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic
   potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant
   microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher
   proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in
   controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short
   chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key
   rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls.
   These data suggest that a consortium of lactate-and butyrate-producing
   bacteria in a healthy gut induce a sufficient amount of mucin synthesis
   to maintain gut integrity. In contrast, non-butyrate-producing
   lactate-utilizing bacteria prevent optimal mucin synthesis, as
   identified in autoimmune subjects.}},

   well-established, particularly in men, and may be modified by gender.
   Objective: To assess whether high dietary GL and GI increase the risk of
   CVD in men and women.
   Methods: A large prospective cohort study (EPIC-MORGEN) was conducted
   within the general Dutch population among 8,855 men and 10,753 women,
   aged 21-64 years at baseline (1993-1997) and free of diabetes and CVD.
   Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency
   questionnaire and GI and GL were calculated using Foster-Powell's
   international table of GI. Information on morbidity and mortality was
   obtained through linkage with national registries. Cox proportional
   hazards analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for

Abstract = {{Background: A simple diabetes risk tool that does not require laboratory
   tests would be beneficial in screening individuals at higher risk. Few
   studies have evaluated the ability of these tools to identify new cases
   of pre-diabetes. This study aimed to assess the ability of the American
   Diabetes Association Risk Tool (ADART) to predict the 3-year incidence
   of pre-diabetes and diabetes in Taiwanese.
   Methods: This was a 3-year prospective study of 1021 residents with
   normoglycemia at baseline, gathered from a random sample of residents
   aged 40-88 years in a metropolitan city in Taiwan. The areas under the
   curve (AUCs) of three models were compared: ADART only, ADART plus
   lifestyle behaviors at baseline, and ADART plus lifestyle behaviors and
   biomarkers at baseline. The performance of ADART was compared with that
   of 16 tools that had been reported in the literature.
   Results: The AUCs and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.60
   (0.54-0.66) for men and 0.72 (0.66-0.77) for women in model 1; 0.62
   (0.56-0.68) for men and 0.74 (0.68-0.80) for women in model 2; and 0.64
   (0.58-0.71) for men and 0.75 (0.69-0.80) for women in model 3. The AUCs
   of these three models were all above 0.7 in women, but not in men. No
   significant difference in either women or men (p = 0.268 and 0.156,
   respectively) was observed in the AUC of these three models. Compared to
   16 tools published in the literature, ADART had the second largest AUC
   in both men and women.
   Conclusions: ADART is a good screening tool for predicting the
   three-year incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in females of a
   Taiwanese population. The performance of ADART in men was similar to the
   results with other tools published in the literature. Its performance

Abstract = {{Background: Performance indicators assessing quality of diabetes care
   often look at single processes, e. g. whether an HbA1c test was
   conducted. Adequate care, however, consists of consecutive processes
   which should be taken in time (clinical pathways). We assessed quality
   of diabetes care by looking at single processes versus clinical
   pathways. In addition, we evaluated the impact of time period
   definitions on this quality assessment.
   Methodology: We conducted a cohort study in 2007-2008 using the GIANTT
   (Groningen Initiative to Analyse type 2 diabetes Treatment) database.
   Proportions of patients adequately managed for HbA1c, systolic blood
   pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and albumin/creatinin ratio
   (ACR) were calculated for the pathway of (1) risk factor level testing,
   (2) treatment intensification when indicated, (3) response to treatment
   evaluation. Strict and wide time periods for each step were defined.
   Proportions of patients adequately managed regarding the overall pathway
   and single steps, using strict or wide time periods were compared using
   odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals.
   Findings: Of 11176 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 9439 with
   complete follow-up were included. The majority received annual
   examination of HbA1c (86\%) and SBP (86\%), whereas this was 67\% for
   LDL-C and 49\% for ACR. Adequate management regarding the three-step
   pathway was observed in 73\%, 53\%, 46\%, 41\% of patients for HbA1c,
   SBP, LDL-C, and ACR respectively. Quality scores reduced significantly
   due to the second step (OR 0.43, 0.18, 0.44, 0.74), but were not much
   further reduced by the third step. Timely treatment evaluation occurred
   in 88\% for HbA1c, 87\% for SBP, 83\% for LDL-C, and 76\% for ACR. The
   overall score was not significantly changed by using strict time
   windows.
   Conclusion: Quality estimates of glycemic, blood pressure and
   cholesterol management are substantially reduced when looking at
   clinical pathways as compared to estimates based on commonly used simple
   process measures.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aims of this paper were to study the reporting rate and
   completeness of data reported from primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in
   Sweden to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), with a special
   attention on the relation between these measures and the reporting
   system used by the PHCCs.
   Method: A national survey conducted in Swedish primary healthcare
   covering the year 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect data from
   523 PHCCs. Data on 87,099 adult diabetic patients attending these PHCCs
   and reported to the NDR were obtained from the register. In Sweden,
   participation in the NDR is voluntary. The data were reported through
   the Internet, either online using a web-based system or by direct
   transmission. The main outcome measures were reporting rate and
   completeness of reported data.
   Results: Of the 523 PHCCs, almost two-thirds had reported <75\% of their
   diabetic patients to the NDR. The lowest reporting rate was found among
   the largest PHCCs, while the highest was found among small PHCCs (p <
   0.001). Reasons given for not reporting data to the NDR were lack of
   time and lack of personnel resources. Altogether, 73.1\% of the PHCCs
   reported data to the NDR online using a web-based system, 20.5\% used
   direct transmission and 6.3\% used both systems. The PHCCs that reported
   data through direct transmission systems reported almost 70\% of their
   diabetic patients to the NDR, while PHCCs using web-based systems
   reported 54\% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. Adjusted for other
   factors, using direct transmission increased the reporting rate by 13.0
   percentage points. However, the web-based system contributed to a higher
   completeness of data than the direct transmission system.
   Conclusions: A direct transmission system facilitates a high reporting
   rate to the register at the expense of lower completeness of the
   reported data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Diabetes Is a Risk Factor for Pulmonary Tuberculosis: A Case-Control
   Study from Mwanza, Tanzania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diabetes and TB are associated, and diabetes is increasingly
   common in low-income countries where tuberculosis (TB) is highly
   endemic. However, the role of diabetes for TB has not been assessed in
   populations where HIV is prevalent.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted in an urban population in
   Tanzania among culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients and non-TB
   neighbourhood controls. Participants were tested for diabetes according
   to WHO guidelines and serum concentrations of acute phase reactants were
   measured. The association between diabetes and TB, and the role of HIV
   as an effect modifier, were examined using logistic regression. Since
   blood glucose levels increase during the acute phase response, we
   adjusted for elevated serum acute phase reactants.
   Results: Among 803 cases and 350 controls the mean (SD) age was 34.8
   (11.9) and 33.8 (12.0) years, and the prevalence of diabetes was 16.7\%
   (95\% CI: 14.2; 19.4) and 9.4\% (6.6; 13.0), respectively. Diabetes was
   associated with TB (OR 2.2, 95\% CI: 1.5; 3.4, p < 0.001). However, the
   association depended on HIV status (interaction, p = 0.01) due to a
   stronger association among HIV uninfected (OR 4.2, 95\% CI: 1.5; 11.6, p
   = 0.01) compared to HIV infected (OR 0.1, 95\% CI: 0.01; 1.8, p = 0.13)
   after adjusting for age, sex, demographic factors and elevated serum
   acute phase reactants.
   Conclusion: Diabetes is a risk factor for TB in HIV uninfected, whereas
   the association in HIV infected patients needs further study. The
   increasing diabetes prevalence may be a threat to TB control.}},

Title = {{HbA1c of 6.5\% to Diagnose Diabetes Mellitus - Does It Work for Us? -
   The Bellville South Africa Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: HbA1c has been the gold standard for glycaemic control
   follow-up for decades. In 2009, a level of 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol) was
   proposed as diagnostic for diabetes. We test this cut-off in our
   community.
   Methods: Participants (946) from a community-based study were screened
   for diabetes using either a fasting blood glucose or oral glucose
   tolerance test (OFTT). The HbA1c cut-off of 6.5\% was tested for each
   group. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for both groups
   was generated to establish an optimal cut-off.
   Results: Our study included 224 (23.7\%) males and 722 (76.3\%) females.
   Using fasting blood glucose alone, 117 (14\%) were diagnosed with
   diabetes -250\% had an HbA1c value of >= 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol). Using an
   OGTT, 147 (18\%) were diagnosed with diabetes -246\% had an HbA1c value
   of >= 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol). ROC curves found a level of 6.1\% (43
   mmol/mol) to be optimal in both groups (AUC 0.85 and 0.82 respectively).
   The sensitivities were 80\% and 75\% and the specificities 77\% and 78\%
   respectively.
   Conclusions: A cut off of 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol) is a good diagnostic tool
   with its high specificity; however the low sensitivity limits its use.
   We found a level of 6.1\% (43 mmol/mol) to be optimal. This emphasizes
   the need for evidenced based values to be established in various
   population groups.}},

Title = {{Increased Recruitment but Impaired Function of Leukocytes during

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients suffering from diabetes show defective bacterial
   clearance. This study investigates the effects of elevated plasma
   glucose levels during diabetes on leukocyte recruitment and function in
   established models of inflammation.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Diabetes was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by
   intravenous alloxan (causing severe hyperglycemia), or by high fat diet
   (moderate hyperglycemia). Leukocyte recruitment was studied in
   anaesthetized mice using intravital microscopy of exposed cremaster
   muscles, where numbers of rolling, adherent and emigrated leukocytes
   were quantified before and during exposure to the inflammatory chemokine
   MIP-2 (0.5 nM). During basal conditions, prior to addition of chemokine,
   the adherent and emigrated leukocytes were increased in both alloxan-(62
   +/- 18\% and 85 +/- 21\%, respectively) and high fat diet-induced (77
   +/- 25\% and 86 +/- 17\%, respectively) diabetes compared to control
   mice. MIP-2 induced leukocyte emigration in all groups, albeit
   significantly more cells emigrated in alloxan-treated mice (15.3 +/-
   1.0) compared to control (8.0 +/- 1.1) mice. Bacterial clearance was
   followed for 10 days after subcutaneous injection of bioluminescent S.
   aureus using non-invasive IVIS imaging, and the inflammatory response
   was assessed by Myeloperoxidase-ELISA and confocal imaging. The
   phagocytic ability of leukocytes was assessed using LPS-coated
   fluorescent beads and flow cytometry. Despite efficient leukocyte
   recruitment, alloxan-treated mice demonstrated an impaired ability to
   clear bacterial infection, which we found correlated to a 50\% decreased
   phagocytic ability of leukocytes in diabetic mice.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that reduced ability to
   clear bacterial infections observed during experimentally induced
   diabetes is not due to reduced leukocyte recruitment since sustained
   hyperglycemia results in increased levels of adherent and emigrated
   leukocytes in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Instead,
   decreased phagocytic ability observed for leukocytes isolated from
   diabetic mice might account for the impaired bacterial clearance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified more
   than 30 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Caucasians.
   However, genomic understanding of T2D in Asians, especially Han Chinese,
   is still limited.
   Methods and Principal Findings: A two-stage GWAS was performed in Han
   Chinese from Mainland China. The discovery stage included 793 T2D cases
   and 806 healthy controls genotyped using Illumina Human 660- and
   610-Quad BeadChips; and the replication stage included two independent
   case-control populations (a total of 4445 T2D cases and 4458 controls)
   genotyped using TaqMan assay. We validated the associations of KCNQ1

Abstract = {{The medicinal use and commercialisation of the plants Aloe ferox and
   Aloe greatheadii are primarily based on research done on Aloe vera and
   Aloe arborescens. Consequently, in this study we investigated the
   possible antidiabetic effects of ethanol extracts of A. ferox and A.
   greatheadii var. davyana leaf gel in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type
   2 diabetes rat model. Fifty male Wistar rats, weighing 200 g 250 g, were
   randomly divided into five groups of n =10: normal control rats,
   diabetic control rats, diabetic rats receiving A. ferox leaf gel extract
   (300 mg/kg), diabetic rats receiving A. greatheadii leaf gel extract
   (300 mg/kg), and diabetic rats receiving glibenclamide (600 mu g/kg).
   Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (40
   mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed 5 weeks after injection, following a
   12-hour fast, and blood and tissue samples were collected. Compared to
   the normal control group, STZ significantly increased relative liver and
   kidney weights, end-point plasma glucose, fructosamine, oxidative
   stress, liver enzymes, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, very low
   density lipoprotein-cholesterol and TC: high density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) values and reduced serum insulin levels.
   Treatment with A. greatheadii moderately increased serum insulin and
   HDL-C levels and moderately reduced end-point plasma glucose and liver
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and significantly decreased TC:HDL-C ratios.
   A. ferox supplementation similarly resulted in moderately increased
   serum insulin, accompanied by slight corrections in ALP and HDL-C,
   without any change to end-point plasma glucose values. A. greatheadii
   and, to a lesser extent, A. ferox, resulted in a clinically relevant
   improved diabetic state (indicated by moderate to high effect sizes),
   suggesting that these Aloe species may show promise for treating
   diabetes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Preclinical and observational studies raise the concern
   about the safety of insulin glargine in terms of cancer initiation and
   promotion. This study is designed to examine cancer incidence associated
   with use of insulin glargine vs. intermediate/long-acting human insulin
   (HI).
   Methodology: A retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National
   Health Insurance claims database was conducted to identify adult
   patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without a history of cancer
   who initiated insulin glargine (n = 10,190) or intermediate/long-acting
   HI (n = 49,253) during 2004-2007. Exclusive users were followed from the
   date of insulin initiation to the earliest of cancer diagnosis, death,
   disenrollment, or December 31 2007. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) with Cox proportional hazards models
   adjusting for baseline propensity score.
   Findings: The incidence rate of all cancer per 1,000 person-years was
   13.8 for insulin glargine initiators (179 cases) and 16.0 for
   intermediate/long-acting HI initiators (1,445 cases) during an average
   follow-up of 2 years. No significant difference in overall cancer risk
   between insulin glargine initiators and HI initiators was found. For
   men, however, the adjusted hazard ratio of insulin glargine use as
   compared with intermediate/long-acting HI was 2.15 (95\% CI 1.01-4.59)
   for pancreatic cancer, and 2.42 (95\% CI 1.50-8.40) for prostate cancer.
   The increased risk was not observed among women.
   Conclusions: Insulin glargine use did not increase the risk of overall
   cancer incidence as compared with HI. The positive associations with
   pancreatic and prostate cancer need further evaluation and validation.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, we have carried out an autosomal genome-wide
   linkage analysis to map genes associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
   five quantitative traits of blood lipids including total cholesterol,
   high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
   (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and
   triglycerides in a unique family-based cohort from the Sikh Diabetes
   Study (SDS). A total of 870 individuals (526 male/344 female) from 321
   families were successfully genotyped using 398 polymorphic
   microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 9.26 cM on the
   autosomes. Results of non-parametric multipoint linkage analysis using
   Sall statistics (implemented in Merlin) did not reveal any chromosomal
   region to be significantly associated with T2D in this Sikh cohort.
   However, linkage analysis for lipid traits using QTL-ALL analysis
   revealed promising linkage signals with p <= 0.005 for total
   cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol at chromosomes 5p15,
   9q21, 10p11, 10q21, and 22q13. The most significant signal (p = 0.0011)

   signals for total cholesterol at 22q13.32 (p = 0.0016) and 5p15.33 (p =

   some of linkage regions identified in this Sikh population coincide with
   plausible candidate genes reported in recent genome-wide association and
   meta-analysis studies for lipid traits. Our study provides the first
   evidence of linkage for loci associated with quantitative lipid traits

   More detailed examination of these regions with more informative

   established cardiometabolic risk factors in the prediction of incident
   type 2 diabetes and incident coronary events in a prospective

   Methods and Findings: Analyses for type 2 diabetes are based on 436
   individuals with and 1410 individuals without incident diabetes.
   Analyses for coronary events are based on 314 individuals with and 1659
   individuals without incident coronary events. Mean follow-up times were
   almost 11 years. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve
   (AUC), changes in Akaike's information criterion (Delta AIC), integrated
   discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI)
   were calculated for different models. A basic model consisting of age,
   sex and survey predicted type 2 diabetes with an AUC of 0.690. Addition
   of 13 inflammation-related biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, IL-18, MIF,
   MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10, adiponectin, leptin, RANTES/CCL5,
   TGF-beta 1, sE-selectin, sICAM-1; all measured in nonfasting serum)
   increased the AUC to 0.801, whereas addition of cardiometabolic risk
   factors (BMI, systolic blood pressure, ratio total/HDL-cholesterol,
   smoking, alcohol, physical activity, parental diabetes) increased the
   AUC to 0.803 (Delta AUC {[}95\% CI] 0.111 {[}0.092-0.149] and 0.113
   {[}0.093-0.149], respectively, compared to the basic model). The
   combination of all inflammation-related biomarkers and cardiometabolic
   risk factors yielded a further increase in AUC to 0.847 (Delta AUC
   {[}95\% CI] 0.044 {[}0.028-0.066] compared to the cardiometabolic risk
   model). Corresponding AUCs for incident coronary events were 0.807,
   0.825 (Delta AUC {[}95\% CI] 0.018 {[}0.013-0.038] compared to the basic
   model), 0.845 (Delta AUC {[}95\% CI] 0.038 {[}0.028-0.059] compared to
   the basic model) and 0.851 (Delta AUC {[}95\% CI] 0.006 {[}0.003-0.021]
   compared to the cardiometabolic risk model), respectively.
   Conclusions: Inclusion of multiple inflammation-related biomarkers into
   a basic model and into a model including cardiometabolic risk factors
   significantly improved the prediction of type 2 diabetes and coronary
   events, although the improvement was less pronounced for the latter
   endpoint.}},

Abstract = {{Background: EGb761, a standardized Ginkgo biloba extract, has
   antioxidant and antiplatelet aggregation and thus might protect against
   atherosclerosis. However, molecular and functional properties of EGb761
   and its major subcomponents have not been well characterized. We
   investigated the effect of EGb761 and its major subcomponents
   (bilobalide, kaemferol, and quercetin) on preventing atherosclerosis in
   vitro, and in a rat model of type 2 diabetes.
   Methods and Results: EGb761 (100 and 200 mg/kg) or normal saline
   (control) were administered to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats,
   an obese insulin-resistant rat model, for 6 weeks (from 3 weeks before
   to 3 weeks after carotid artery injury). Immunohistochemical staining
   was performed to investigate cell proliferation and apoptosis in the
   injured arteries. Cell migration, caspase-3 activity and DNA
   fragmentation, monocyte adhesion, and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels were explored
   in vitro. Treatment with EGb761 dose-dependently reduced intima-media
   ratio, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and induced
   greater apoptosis than the controls. Proliferation and migration of
   VSMCs in vitro were also decreased by the treatment of EGb761. Glucose
   homeostasis and circulating adiponectin levels were improved, and plasma
   hsCRP concentrations were decreased in the treatment groups. Caspase-3
   activity and DNA fragmentation increased while monocyte adhesion and
   ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels decreased significantly. Among subcomponents of
   EGb761, kaemferol and quercetin reduced VSMC migration and increased
   caspase activity.
   Conclusions: EGb761 has a protective role in the development of
   atherosclerosis and is a potential therapeutic agent for preventing
   atherosclerosis.}},

Title = {{Investigating the Role of T-Cell Avidity and Killing Efficacy in
   Relation to Type 1 Diabetes Prediction}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{During the progression of the clinical onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D),
   high-risk individuals exhibit multiple islet autoantibodies and
   high-avidity T cells which progressively destroy beta cells causing
   overt T1D. In particular, novel autoantibodies, such as those against
   IA-2 epitopes (aa1-577), had a predictive rate of 100\% in a 10-year
   follow up (rapid progressors), unlike conventional autoantibodies that
   required 15 years of follow up for a 74\% predictive rate (slow
   progressors). The discrepancy between these two groups is thought to be
   associated with T-cell avidity, including CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells.
   For this purpose, we build a series of mathematical models incorporating
   first one clone then multiple clones of islet-specific and pathogenic
   CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells, together with B lymphocytes, to
   investigate the interaction of T-cell avidity with autoantibodies in
   predicting disease onset. These models are instrumental in examining
   several experimental observations associated with T-cell avidity,
   including the phenomenon of avidity maturation (increased average T-cell
   avidity over time), based on intra-and cross-clonal competition between
   T cells in high-risk human subjects. The model shows that the level and
   persistence of autoantibodies depends not only on the avidity of T
   cells, but also on the killing efficacy of these cells. Quantification
   and modeling of autoreactive T-cell avidities can thus determine the
   level of risk associated with each type of autoantibodies and the timing
   of T1D disease onset in individuals that have been tested positive for
   these autoantibodies. Such studies may lead to early diagnosis of the
   disease in high-risk individuals and thus potentially serve as a means
   of staging patients for clinical trials of preventive or interventional
   therapies far before disease onset.}},

Abstract = {{Tight glycemic control (TGC) has emerged as a major research focus in
   critical care due to its potential to simultaneously reduce both
   mortality and costs. However, repeating initial successful TGC trials
   that reduced mortality and other outcomes has proven difficult with more
   failures than successes. Hence, there has been growing debate over the
   necessity of TGC, its goals, the risk of severe hypoglycemia, and target
   cohorts.
   This paper provides a review of TGC via new analyses of data from
   several clinical trials, including SPRINT, Glucontrol and a recent NICU
   study. It thus provides both a review of the problem and major
   background factors driving it, as well as a novel model-based analysis
   designed to examine these dynamics from a new perspective. Using these
   clinical results and analysis, the goal is to develop new insights that
   shed greater light on the leading factors that make TGC difficult and
   inconsistent, as well as the requirements they thus impose on the design
   and implementation of TGC protocols.
   A model-based analysis of insulin sensitivity using data from three
   different critical care units, comprising over 75,000 h of clinical
   data, is used to analyse variability in metabolic dynamics using a
   clinically validated model-based insulin sensitivity metric (S(I)).
   Variation in S(I) provides a new interpretation and explanation for the
   variable results seen (across cohorts and studies) in applying TGC. In
   particular, significant intra- and inter-patient variability in insulin
   resistance (1/S(I)) is seen be a major confounder that makes TGC
   difficult over diverse cohorts, yielding variable results over many
   published studies and protocols. Further factors that exacerbate this
   variability in glycemic outcome are found to include measurement
   frequency and whether a protocol is blind to carbohydrate
   administration. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disorder resulting from the autoimmune
   destruction of insulin-producing cells, a leading cause of morbidity and
   mortality all over the world. In this study a tissue engineering
   approach was compared with a macroencapsulation approach to reverse type
   1 diabetes in a rat model. using mouse pancreatic progenitor cell
   (PPC)-derived islet-like clusters and mouse islets. For the tissue
   engineering approach the cells were cultured on gelatin scaffolds
   cross-linked with EDC in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in vitro
   (GPE scaffolds), while for the macroencapsulation approach the cells
   were encapsulated in polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone
   semi-Interpenetrating networks. In the combination approach the cells
   cultured on GPE scaffolds were further encapsulated in a
   polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone capsule. Real time PCR studies and the
   glucose challenge assay have shown that cells on GPE scaffolds could
   express and secrete insulin and glucagon in vitro. However, under in
   vivo conditions the animals treated by the tissue engineering approach
   died within 15-20 days and showed no reversal of their diabetes, due to
   infiltration of immune cells such as CD4 and CD8 cells and macrophages.
   In the macroencapsulation approach the animals showed euglycemia within
   25 days, which was maintained for further 20 days, but after that the
   animals died. Interestingly, in the combination approach the animals
   showed reversal of hyperglycemia, and remained euglycemic for up to 3
   months. The time needed to achieve initial euglycemia was different with
   different cell types, i e. the combination approach with mouse Islets
   achieved euglycemia within 15 days, whereas with PPC-derived islet-like
   clusters euglycemia was achieved within 25 days This study confirmed
   that a combination of tissue engineering and macroencapsulation with

   and type 2 diabetes in clinical practice.
   Design: Observational population-based study using the personal
   identification number to link information from the National Diabetes
   Register, the Prescribed Drug Register and the Patient register in
   Sweden. All patients in the NDR aged 18-75 years with diabetes more than
   one year were eligible, but only patients starting any lipid lowering
   treatment with at least three prescriptions 1 July 2006-30 June 2007
   were included (n = 37182). The mean blood lipid levels in 2008 and
   reductions in LDL cholesterol were examined.
   Results: Blood lipid levels were similar in patients treated with
   simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, showing similar lipid
   lowering effect as currently used. Users of pravastatin, fluvastatin,
   ezetimib and fibrate more seldom reach treatment goals. Moderate daily
   doses of the statins were used, with 76\% of simvastatin users taking 20
   mg or less, 48\% of atorvastatin users taking 10 mg, 55\% of pravastatin
   users taking 20 mg, and 76\% of rosuvastatin users taking 5 or 10 mg.
   Conclusions: This observational study shows that the LDL-C levels in
   patients taking simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are very
   similar as currently used, as well as their LDL-C lowering abilities.
   There is potential to intensify lipid lowering treatment to reduce the
   remaining high residual risk and achieve better fulfilment of treatment
   goals, since the commonly used doses are only low to moderate.}},

   Non-Obese Type 2 Diabetes Model Goto-Kakizaki Rat}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a well-studied non-obese
   spontaneous type 2 diabetes (T2D) animal model characterized by impaired
   glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the pancreatic beta
   cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs involved in many
   fundamental biological processes. We aim to identify miRNAs that are
   differentially-expressed in the pancreatic islets of the GK rats and
   investigate both their short-and long term glucose-dependence during
   glucose-stimulatory conditions.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Global profiling of 348 miRNAs in the
   islets of GK rats and Wistar controls (females, 60 days, N = 6 for both
   sets) using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based microarrays allowed for the
   clear separation of the two groups. Significant analysis of microarrays
   (SAM) identified 30 differentially-expressed miRNAs, 24 of which are
   predominantly upregulated in the GK rat islets. Monitoring of
   qPCR-validated miRNAs during GSIS experiments on isolated islets showed
   disparate expression trajectories between GK and controls indicating
   distinct short-and long-term glucose dependence. We specifically found
   expression of rno-miR-130a, rno-miR-132, rno-miR-212 and rno-miR-335 to
   be regulated by hyperglycaemia. The putative targets of upregulated
   miRNAs in the GK, filtered with glucose-regulated mRNAs, were found to
   be enriched for insulin-secretion genes known to be downregulated in T2D
   patients. Finally, the binding of rno-miR-335 to a fragment of the 3'UTR
   of one of known down-regulated exocytotic genes in GK islets, Stxbp1 was
   shown by luciferase assay.
   Conclusions/Significance: The perturbed miRNA network found in the GK
   rat islets is indicative of a system-wide impairment in the regulation
   of genes important for the normal functions of pancreatic islets,
   particularly in processes involving insulin secretion during glucose
   stimulatory conditions. Our findings suggest that the reduced insulin
   secretion observed in the GK rat may be partly due to upregulated miRNA
   expression leading to decreased production of key proteins of the
   insulin exocytotic machinery.}},

   selective inhibitor of mammalian fatty acid synthase. In contrast to two
   agents, C75 and cerulenin, that are widely used as inhibitors of
   mammalian fatty acid synthase, platensimycin specifically inhibits fatty
   acid synthesis but not sterol synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes. PTM
   preferentially concentrates in liver when administered orally to mice
   and potently inhibits hepatic de novo lipogenesis, reduces fatty acid
   oxidation, and increases glucose oxidation. Chronic administration of
   platensimycin led to a net reduction in liver triglyceride levels and
   improved insulin sensitivity in db/+ mice fed a high-fructose diet. PTM
   also reduced ambient glucose levels in db/db mice. These results provide

Abstract = {{Background: A pilot study was performed in order to investigate the
   effects of bariatric surgery on whole blood gene expression profiles in
   obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Whole blood from eleven obese subjects
   with type 2 diabetes was collected in PAXgene tubes prior to and 6-12
   months after bariatric surgery. Total RNA was isolated, amplified,
   labeled and hybridized to Illumina gene expression microarrays. Clinical
   and expression data were analyzed using a paired t-test, and
   correlations between changes in clinical trait and transcript levels
   were calculated. Pathways were identified using Ingenuity Pathway
   Analysis and DAVID gene ontology software. Overall, bariatric surgery
   resulted in significant reduction of body mass index, fasting plasma
   glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and normalization of glycosylated
   hemoglobin levels. The expression levels of 204 transcripts,
   representing 200 unique genes, were significantly altered after
   bariatric surgery. Among the significantly regulated genes were GGT1,
   CAMP, DEFA1, LCN2, TP53, PDSS1, OLR1, CNTNAP5, DHCR24, HHAT and SARDH,
   which have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism, obesity
   and/or type 2 diabetes. Selected findings were replicated by
   quantitative real-time-PCR. The changes in expression of seven
   transcripts, WDR35, FLF45244, DHCR24, TIGD7, TOPBP1, TSHZ1, and FAM8A1
   were strongly correlated with the changes in body weight, fasting plasma
   glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin content. The top pathways associated
   with gene expression changes after bariatric surgery was lipid
   metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and gene expression. Two
   antimicrobial peptides were among the transcripts with the largest
   changes in gene expression after bariatric surgery.
   Conclusions/Significance: Data from this pilot study suggest that whole
   blood expression levels of specific transcripts may be useful as
   biomarkers associated with susceptibility for type 2 diabetes and/or

Abstract = {{The rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are rising to epidemic proportions in
   the US and worldwide. While current T2D medications are efficacious,
   significant side effects have limited their use and availability. Our
   laboratory has discovered that abscisic acid (ABA) exerts anti-diabetic
   effects, in part, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). However, since ABA does not bind to the
   ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR gamma, the mechanism of activation
   of PPAR gamma by ABA remains unknown. Lanthionine synthetase component
   C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) was predicted to be a novel target for the
   binding and signaling of ABA in human granulocytes and rat insulinoma
   cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether LANCL2 is a
   molecular target of ABA and other PPAR gamma agonists. To this end we
   performed homology modeling to construct a three-dimensional structure
   of LANCL2 using the crystal structure of LANCL1 as a template. Our
   molecular docking studies predicted that ABA and other PPAR gamma
   agonists (e.g., rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) share a binding site on
   the surface of LANCL2. The identification of a binding site for PPAR
   gamma agonists will facilitate the high-throughput virtual screening of
   large compound libraries and may shed new light on alternative
   mechanisms of PPAR gamma activation.}},

Abstract = {{How to design a clinical test aimed at identifying in the safest, most
   precise and quickest way the subject-specific parameters of a detailed
   model of glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes is the topic of this
   article. Recently, standard techniques of model-based design of
   experiments (MBDoE) for parameter identification have been proposed to
   design clinical tests for the identification of the model parameters for
   a single type 1 diabetic individual. However, standard MBDoE is affected
   by some limitations. In particular, the existence of a structural
   mismatch between the responses of the subject and that of the model to
   be identified, together with initial uncertainty in the model parameters
   may lead to design clinical tests that are sub-optimal (scarcely
   informative) or even unsafe (the actual response of the subject might be
   hypoglycaemic or strongly hyperglycaemic). The integrated use of two
   advanced MBDoE techniques (online model-based redesign of experiments
   and backoff-based MBDoE) is proposed in this article as a way to
   effectively tackle the above issue. Online model-based experiment
   redesign is utilised to exploit the information embedded in the
   experimental data as soon as the data become available, and to adjust
   the clinical test accordingly whilst the test is running. Backoff-based
   MBDoE explicitly accounts for model parameter uncertainty, and allows
   one to plan a test that is both optimally informative and safe by

Abstract = {{A porous large poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MS)
   adsorbed with palmityl-acylated exendin-4 (Ex4-C(16)) was devised as an
   inhalation delivery system. The porous MS was prepared by a single o/w
   emulsification/solvent evaporation method using extractable Pluronic
   F68/F127, and its fabrication and formulation conditions were carefully
   optimized. Results show that the prepared MS was in the appropriate size
   range for inhalation and contained many surfaces and internal pores
   meaning low aerodynamic density. Ex4-C(16) was more efficiently adsorbed
   onto porous PLGA MSs than native exendin-4, and an approximately 5\%
   loading of Ex4-C(16) onto this porous MS (RG504H) was achieved. This
   optimized porous MS was found to be efficiently deposited throughout the
   entire lungs of mice including alveoli region. Furthermore, this porous
   MS adsorbed with Ex4-C(16) (approx. 100 mu g/mouse) displayed much
   protracted hypoglycemic efficacy in non-fasted type 2 diabetic db/db
   mice. Porous PLGA MS with adsorbed Ex4-C(16) showed the dual-advantages
   of (i) sustained release and acceptable drug-loading due to strong
   hydrophobic interaction and (ii) longer in vivo pulmonary hypoglycemic
   duration due to albumin-binding by the palmityl group. We consider that
   this new prototype of porous PLGA MS has considerable pharmaceutical
   potential as a type 2 anti-diabetic inhalation treatment. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{An increasing number of decision support systems based on domain
   knowledge are adopted to diagnose medical conditions such as diabetes
   and heart disease. It is widely pointed that the classical ontologies
   cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real
   world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and
   knowledge problems with uncertainty. This paper presents a novel fuzzy
   expert system for diabetes decision support application. A five-layer
   fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation
   layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and
   fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to
   describe knowledge with uncertainty. By applying the novel fuzzy
   ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes
   ontology (FDO) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. Additionally,
   a semantic decision support agent (SDSA), including a knowledge
   construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and
   semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. The
   knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and
   relations based on the structure of the FDO. The instances of the FDO
   are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. Finally, based
   on the FDO and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making
   mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for
   diabetes-related application. Importantly, the proposed fuzzy expert
   system can work effectively for diabetes decision support application.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting the full potential of telemedical systems means using
   platform based solutions: data are recovered from biomedical sensors,
   hospital information systems, care-givers, as well as patients
   themselves, and are processed and redistributed in an either centralized
   or, more probably, decentralized way. The integration of all these
   different devices, and interfaces, as well as the automated analysis and
   representation of all the pieces of information are current key
   challenges in telemedicine.
   Mobile phone technology has just begun to offer great opportunities of
   using this diverse information for guiding, warning, and educating
   patients, thus increasing their autonomy and adherence to their
   prescriptions. However, most of these existing mobile solutions are not
   based on platform systems and therefore represent limited, isolated
   applications.
   This article depicts how telemedical systems, based on integrated health
   data platforms, can maximize prescription adherence in chronic patients
   through mobile feedback. The application described here has been
   developed in an EU-funded R\&D project called METABO, dedicated to

   become increasingly common among children. This paper presents our work
   of implementing an individualized real time predictive system for blood

   application, called HealthiManage, provides relevant feedback to
   patients at each glucose input reading comparing the measured and
   predicted readings, facilitating improved self-management of the
   disease. The application incorporates activity recognition via a
   built-in accelerometer on the iPhone, which monitors any physical
   activity and adjusts predictions accordingly. Also, a reward component
   interface was incorporated that is intended to enhance patient

Abstract = {{Goal of this study is to model the long-term health care and economic
   consequences of the new antidiabetic medicine (liraglutide) for the
   health care system in Bulgaria using the CORE diabetes model. The CORE
   diabetes model is a disease computer simulation model developed to
   project long-term health and social outcomes of interventions in type 1
   and type 2 diabetes, taking into account diabetes therapies, screening
   and treatment strategies for microvascular and end-stage complications,
   and multifactorial interventions. A total of 66 internal and external
   validation analyses were performed across a range of complications and
   outcomes simulated by the model. Disease progression probabilities and
   treatment pathways were based on published sources, and 7 modifiable
   risk factors of diabetes were used (HbA(1c), SBP, T-Chol, HDL, LDL,
   Triglycerides and BMI). The model was based on a series of 16
   interdependent Markov sub-models that simulate a progression of
   disease-related complications.
   As a result from the modelling the quality adjusted life years (QALYs)
   of diabetes patients increased with liraglutide 1.2 mg by 0.252 (SD
   0.129) years. Total costs increased by BGN 7722 resulting in an
   incremental cost per QALY gained which amounted to BGN 30 674. The
   univaried sensitivity analyses for liraglutide 1.2 mg revealed
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALY ranging from BGN 23 699 to
   BGN 156 330, when no discount rate for both future costs and outcomes
   was applied and change in HbA(1c) on par with comparator was set,
   respectively. Liraglutide 1.2 mg was shown to be cost effective for the
   treatment of type 2 diabetes if the willingness to pay thresholds was
   around BGN 30 000 per additional QALY gained.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of
   liraglutide combined with metformin (MET) and/or sulfonylurea therapy
   (SU) in comparison with exenatide in combination with MET and/or SU
   therapy in type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with MET and/or SU.
   The study was conducted with respect to conditions of the Bulgarian
   health care system, from the perspective of the health care services
   payer and included only direct medical costs and benefits.
   Cost-effectiveness economic analysis was applied to calculate the cost
   per quality adjusted life year (cost/QALY) and the cost per life year
   gained (cost/LYG), after modelling the cost of therapy and results from
   the clinical trial.
   In this model, the Bulgarian cost data were used and therapeutic
   practice analysis was performed. Clinical results were based on the LEAD
   6 trial, patients demographics and health state utility values were used
   as default values determined by the CORE diabetes model. Health state
   utility values for disease and treatment-related outcomes were used to
   determine quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
   In the base case analysis, the total cost of therapy with liraglutide
   was higher than that with exenatide, but the complications cost was
   lower, which could be attributed to better haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
   control. Life expectancy and QALYs increased with liraglutide (1.8 mg
   ones per day) by 0.129 (SD 0.175) and 0.151 (SD 0.124) years,
   respectively. Total costs increased by 4151 Bulgarian Levs (BGN)
   resulting in an incremental cost per LYG of BGN 32 082 and incremental
   costs per QALY gained of BGN 27 404.
   The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that liraglutide (1.8
   mg) can be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared to
   exenatide, with 71\% probability of being a cost-effective treatment
   approach if the willingness to pay threshold is BGN 50 000 (based on
   QALY).
   Liraglutide (1.8 mg) has been shown to be cost effective when compared
   to exenatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes if the hypothetical
   willingness to pay threshold is approximately BGN 50 000 per QALY.}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-22}},
Abstract = {{Background: An increase of diabetes prevalence of up to 80\% is
   predicted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2025 exceeding the worldwide
   55\%. Mortality rates of diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes
   shares several common factors with HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant
   tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health problems have been
   efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical record system
   (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes in
   SSA could be extremely helpful.
   Objectives: The aim was to design and validate a conceptual model for an
   EMRS to improve diabetes management in SSA making use of the HIV and TB
   experience.
   Methods: A review of the literature addressed diabetes care and
   management in SSA as well as existing examples of information and
   communication technology (ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment
   conducted in SSA a conceptual model based on the traditionally
   structured healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a three-layer
   structure. Application modules were derived and a demonstrator
   programmed based on an open source EMRS. Then the approach was validated
   by SSA experts.
   Results: A conceptual model could be specified and validated which
   enhances a problem-oriented approach to diabetes management processes.
   The prototyp EMRS demonstrates options for a patient portal and
   simulation tools for education of health professional and patients in
   SSA.
   Conclusion: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA
   which follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin
   America. The local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will,
   however, depend on training and changes in work behavior.}},

Title = {{Validation of a model-based virtual trials method for tight glycemic
   control in intensive care}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: In-silico virtual patients and trials offer significant
   advantages in cost, time and safety for designing effective tight
   glycemic control (TGC) protocols. However, no such method has fully
   validated the independence of virtual patients (or resulting clinical
   trial predictions) from the data used to create them. This study uses
   matched cohorts from a TGC clinical trial to validate virtual patients
   and in-silico virtual trial models and methods.
   Methods: Data from a 211 patient subset of the Glucontrol trial in
   Liege, Belgium. Glucontrol-A (N = 142) targeted 4.4-6.1 mmol/L and
   Glucontrol-B (N = 69) targeted 7.8-10.0 mmol/L. Cohorts were matched by
   APACHE II score, initial BG, age, weight, BMI and sex (p > 0.25).
   Virtual patients are created by fitting a clinically validated model to
   clinical data, yielding time varying insulin sensitivity profiles
   (SI(t)) that drives in-silico patients.
   Model fit and intra-patient (forward) prediction errors are used to
   validate individual in-silico virtual patients. Self-validation (tests A
   protocol on Group-A virtual patients; and B protocol on B virtual
   patients) and cross-validation (tests A protocol on Group-B virtual
   patients; and B protocol on A virtual patients) are used in comparison
   to clinical data to assess ability to predict clinical trial results.
   Results: Model fit errors were small (<0.25\%) for all patients,
   indicating model fitness. Median forward prediction errors were: 4.3,
   2.8 and 3.5\% for Group-A, Group-B and Overall (A+B), indicating
   individual virtual patients were accurate representations of real
   patients. SI and its variability were similar between cohorts indicating
   they were metabolically similar.
   Self and cross validation results were within 1-10\% of the clinical
   data for both Group-A and Group-B. Self-validation indicated clinically
   insignificant errors due to model and/or clinical compliance.
   Cross-validation clearly showed that virtual patients enabled by
   identified patient-specific SI(t) profiles can accurately predict the
   performance of independent and different TGC protocols.
   Conclusions: This study fully validates these virtual patients and in
   silico virtual trial methods, and clearly shows they can accurately
   simulate, in advance, the clinical results of a TGC protocol, enabling
   rapid in silico protocol design and optimization. These outcomes provide
   the first rigorous validation of a virtual in-silico patient and virtual
   trials methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Walking and cardiovascular mortality are inversely
   associated in type 2 diabetes, but few studies have objectively measured
   associations of walking with individual cardiovascular risk factors.
   Such information would be useful for ``dosing{''} daily steps in
   clinical practice. This study aimed to quantify decrements in blood
   pressure and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) per 1,000 daily step increments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Two hundred and one subjects with type 2
   diabetes underwent assessments of step counts (pedometer-measured),
   blood pressure, A1C and anthropometric parameters. Due to missing data,
   the final analysis was conducted on 83 women and 102 men, with a mean
   age of 60 years. Associations of daily steps with blood pressure and A1C
   were evaluated using sex-specific multivariate linear regression models
   (adjusted for age, ethnicity, and BMI). Potential sex differences were
   confirmed in a combined model (women and men) with interaction terms.
   Mean values for daily steps, blood pressure, A1C and BMI were 5,357
   steps/day; 137/80 mm Hg; 7.7\% and 30.4 kg/m(2) respectively. A 1,000
   daily step increment among women was associated with a -2.6 (95\% CI:
   -4.1 to -1.1) mm Hg change in systolic and a -1.4 (95\% CI: -2.2 to
   -0.6) mm Hg change in diastolic blood pressure. Among men, corresponding
   changes were -0.7 (95\% CI: -2.1 to 0.7) and -0.6 (95\% CI: -1.4 to 0.3)
   mm Hg, respectively. Sex differences were confirmed in combined models.
   Step counts and A1C did not demonstrate clinically important
   associations.
   Conclusions/Significance: A 1,000 steps/day increment is associated with
   important blood pressure decrements among women with type 2 diabetes but
   the data were inconclusive among men. Targeted ``dose increments{''} of
   1,000 steps/day in women may lead to measurable blood pressure
   reductions. This information may be of potential use in the titration or
   ``dosing{''} of daily steps. No associations were found between step
   count increments and A1C.}},

Title = {{Influence of Comorbidities on Therapeutic Progression of Diabetes
   Treatment in Australian Veterans: A Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study assessed whether the number of comorbid
   conditions unrelated to diabetes was associated with a delay in
   therapeutic progression of diabetes treatment in Australian veterans.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A retrospective cohort study was
   undertaken using data from the Australian Department of Veterans'
   Affairs (DVA) claims database between July 2000 and June 2008. The study
   included new users of metformin or sulfonylurea medicines. The outcome
   was the time to addition or switch to another antidiabetic treatment.
   The total number of comorbid conditions unrelated to diabetes was
   identified using the pharmaceutical-based comorbidity index, Rx-Risk-V.
   Competing risk regression analyses were conducted, with adjustments for
   a number of covariates that included age, gender, residential status,
   use of endocrinology service, number of hospitalisation episodes and
   adherence to diabetes medicines. Overall, 20134 veterans were included
   in the study. At one year, 23.5\% of patients with diabetes had a second
   medicine added or had switched to another medicine, with 41.4\%
   progressing by 4 years. The number of unrelated comorbidities was
   significantly associated with the time to addition of an antidiabetic
   medicine or switch to insulin (subhazard ratio {[}SHR] 0.87 {[}95\% CI
   0.84-0.91], P<0.001). Depression, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease were individually associated
   with a decreased likelihood of therapeutic progression. Age, residential
   status, number of hospitalisations and adherence to anti-diabetic
   medicines delayed therapeutic progression.
   Conclusions/Significance: Increasing numbers of unrelated conditions
   decreased the likelihood of therapeutic progression in veterans with
   diabetes. These results have implications for the development of quality
   measures, clinical guidelines and the construction of models of care for
   management of diabetes in elderly people with comorbidities.}},

Title = {{Metabolic Footprint of Diabetes: A Multiplatform Metabolomics Study in
   an Epidemiological Setting}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Metabolomics is the rapidly evolving field of the
   comprehensive measurement of ideally all endogenous metabolites in a
   biological fluid. However, no single analytic technique covers the
   entire spectrum of the human metabolome. Here we present results from a
   multiplatform study, in which we investigate what kind of results can
   presently be obtained in the field of diabetes research when combining
   metabolomics data collected on a complementary set of analytical
   platforms in the framework of an epidemiological study.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: 40 individuals with self-reported
   diabetes and 60 controls (male, over 54 years) were randomly selected
   from the participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health
   Research in the Region of Augsburg) study, representing an extensively
   phenotyped sample of the general German population. Concentrations of
   over 420 unique small molecules were determined in overnight-fasting
   blood using three different techniques, covering nuclear magnetic
   resonance and tandem mass spectrometry. Known biomarkers of diabetes
   could be replicated by this multiple metabolomic platform approach,
   including sugar metabolites (1,5-anhydroglucoitol), ketone bodies
   (3-hydroxybutyrate), and branched chain amino acids. In some cases,
   diabetes-related medication can be detected (pioglitazone, salicylic
   acid).
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study depicts the promising potential of
   metabolomics in diabetes research by identification of a series of known
   and also novel, deregulated metabolites that associate with diabetes.
   Key observations include perturbations of metabolic pathways linked to
   kidney dysfunction (3-indoxyl sulfate), lipid metabolism
   (glycerophospholipids, free fatty acids), and interaction with the gut
   microflora (bile acids). Our study suggests that metabolic markers hold
   the potential to detect diabetes-related complications already under
   sub-clinical conditions in the general population.}},

   Review and Meta-Analysis of Cross-Sectional and Prospective Studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Biological evidence suggests that inflammation might induce
   type 2 diabetes (T2D), and epidemiological studies have shown an
   association between higher white blood cell count (WBC) and T2D.
   However, the association has not been systematically investigated.
   Research Design and Methods: Studies were identified through
   computer-based and manual searches. Previously unreported studies were
   sought through correspondence. 20 studies were identified (8,647 T2D
   cases and 85,040 non-cases). Estimates of the association of WBC with
   T2D were combined using random effects meta-analysis; sources of
   heterogeneity as well as presence of publication bias were explored.
   Results: The combined relative risk (RR) comparing the top to bottom
   tertile of the WBC count was 1.61 (95\% CI: 1.45; 1.79, p =
   1.5{*}10(-18)). Substantial heterogeneity was present (I(2) = 83\%). For
   granulocytes the RR was 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.17; 1.64, p = 1.5{*}10(-4)),
   for lymphocytes 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.02; 1.56, p = 0.029), and for monocytes
   0.93 (95\% CI: 0.68; 1.28, p = 0.67) comparing top to bottom tertile. In
   cross-sectional studies, RR was 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.49; 2.02, p =
   7.7{*}10(-13)), while in cohort studies it was 1.48 (95\% CI: 1.22;
   1.79, p = 7.7{*}10(-5)). We assessed the impact of confounding in
   EPIC-Norfolk study and found that the age and sex adjusted HR of 2.19
   (95\% CI: 1.74; 2.75) was attenuated to 1.82 (95\% CI: 1.45; 2.29) after
   further accounting for smoking, T2D family history, physical activity,
   education, BMI and waist circumference.
   Conclusions: A raised WBC is associated with higher risk of T2D. The
   presence of publication bias and failure to control for all potential
   confounders in all studies means the observed association is likely an
   overestimate.}},

Title = {{In Vivo Islet Protection by a Nuclear Import Inhibitor in a Mouse Model
   of Type 1 Diabetes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{In Background: Insulin-dependent Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating
   autoimmune disease that destroys beta cells within the pancreatic islets
   and afflicts over 10 million people worldwide. These patients face
   life-long risks for blindness, cardiovascular and renal diseases, and
   complications of insulin treatment. New therapies that protect islets
   from autoimmune destruction and allow continuing insulin production are
   needed. Increasing evidence regarding the pathomechanism of T1D
   indicates that islets are destroyed by the relentless attack by
   autoreactive immune cells evolving from an aberrant action of the
   innate, in addition to adaptive, immune system that produces islet-toxic
   cytokines, chemokines, and other effectors of islet inflammation. We
   tested the hypothesis that targeting nuclear import of stress-responsive
   transcription factors evoked by agonist-stimulated innate and adaptive
   immunity receptors would protect islets from autoimmune destruction.
   Principal Findings: Here we show that a first-in-class inhibitor of
   nuclear import, cSN50 peptide, affords in vivo islet protection
   following a 2-day course of intense treatment in NOD mice, which
   resulted in a diabetes-free state for one year without apparent
   toxicity. This nuclear import inhibitor precipitously reduces the
   accumulation of islet-destructive autoreactive lymphocytes while
   enhancing activation-induced cell death of T and B lymphocytes derived
   from autoimmune diabetes-prone, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that
   develop T1D. Moreover, in this widely used model of human T1D we noted
   attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in
   immune cells.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that a novel form of immunotherapy
   that targets nuclear import can arrest inflammation-driven destruction
   of insulin-producing beta cells at the site of autoimmune attack within
   pancreatic islets during the progression of T1D.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The minor T-allele of rs780094 in the glucokinase regulator
   gene (GCKR) associates with a number of metabolic traits including
   higher triglyceride levels and improved glycemic regulation in study
   populations of mostly European ancestry. Using data from the
   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we sought to replicate
   these findings, examine them in a large population-based sample of
   African American study participants, and to investigate independent
   associations with other metabolic traits in order to determine if
   variation in GKCR contributes to their observed clustering. In addition,
   we examined the association of rs780094 with incident diabetes, coronary
   heart disease (CHD), and stroke over up mean follow-up times of 8, 15,
   and 15 years, respectively.
   Research Design and Methods: Race-stratified analyses were conducted
   among 10,929 white and 3,960 black participants aged 45-64 at baseline
   assuming an additive genetic model and using linear and logistic
   regression and Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: Previous findings replicated among white participants in
   multivariable adjusted models: the T-allele of rs780094 was associated
   with lower fasting glucose (p = 10(-7)) and insulin levels (p = 10(-6)),
   lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 10(-9)), less prevalent diabetes
   (p = 10(-6)), and higher CRP (p = 10(-8)), 2-h postprandial glucose
   (OGTT, p = 10(-6)), and triglyceride levels (p = 10(-31)). Moreover, the
   T-allele was independently associated with higher HDL cholesterol levels
   (p = 0.022), metabolic syndrome prevalence (p = 0.043), and lower
   beta-cell function measured as HOMA-B (p = 0.011). Among black
   participants, the T-allele was associated only with higher triglyceride
   levels (p = 0.004) and lower insulin levels (p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (p =
   0.013). Prospectively, the T-allele was associated with reduced
   incidence of diabetes (p = 10(-4)) among white participants, but not
   with incidence of CHD or stroke.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate rs780094 has independent associations
   with multiple metabolic traits as well as incident diabetes, but not
   incident CHD or stroke. The magnitude of association between the SNP and
   most traits was of lower magnitude among African American compared to
   white participants.}},

   Asthma and Autoimmune Diabetes in NOD Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infections may be associated with exacerbation of allergic
   and autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, epidemiological and experimental
   data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these
   pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis
   according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at
   the origin of the increased incidence of both Th1-mediated autoimmune
   diseases and Th2-mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We
   have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can
   recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and
   autoimmunity.
   Methods and Findings: Here, we performed a systematic study of the
   disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists
   using two experimental models, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and
   spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, presenting the same genetic background
   of the non obese diabetic mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both
   pathologies. In the same models, we also investigated the effect of
   probiotics. Additionally, we examined the effect of the genetic
   invalidation of MyD88 on the development of allergic asthma and
   spontaneous diabetes. We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent
   from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally.
   Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases.
   The physiological relevance of these findings is further suggested by
   the major acceleration of OVA-induced asthma in MyD88 invalidated mice.
   Our results strongly indicate that the TLR-mediated effects involve
   immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta and different subsets of regulatory T cells,
   notably CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells for TLR4 agonists and NKT cells
   for TLR3 agonists.
   Conclusions/Significance: These observations demonstrate that systemic
   administration of TLR ligands can suppress both allergic and autoimmune
   responses. They provide a plausible explanation for the hygiene
   hypothesis. They also open new therapeutic perspectives for the
   prevention of these pathologies.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of type 1 diabetes in Europe is increasing at
   a rate of about 3\% per year and there is also an increasing incidence
   throughout the world. Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease caused by
   multiple genetic and environmental factors. Persistent organochlorine
   pollutants (POPs) have been suggested as a triggering factor for
   developing childhood type 1 diabetes. The aim of this case-control study
   was to assess possible impacts of in utero exposure to POPs on type 1
   diabetes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was performed as a
   case-control study within a biobank in Malmo, a city located in the
   Southern part of Sweden. The study included 150 cases (children who had
   their diagnosis mostly before 18 years of age) and 150 controls, matched
   for gender and day of birth. 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153)
   and the major DDT metabolite 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis
   (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) were used as a biomarkers for POP
   exposure. When comparing the quartile with the highest maternal serum
   concentrations of PCB-153 with the other quartiles, an odds ratio (OR)
   of 0.73 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.42, 1.27) was obtained.
   Similar results was obtained for p,p'-DDE (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.29, 1.08).
   Conclusions: The hypothesis that in utero exposure to POPs will trigger
   the risk for developing type 1 diabetes was not supported by the
   results. The risk estimates did, although not statistically significant,
   go in the opposite direction. However, it is not reasonable to believe
   that exposure to POPs should protect against type 1 diabetes.}},

   autonomic neuropathy in patients with diabetes: a pilot study}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autonomic neuropathy is a common and serious complication of
   diabetes. Early detection is essential to enable appropriate
   interventional therapy and management. Dynamic pupillometry has been
   proposed as a simpler and more sensitive tool to detect subclinical
   autonomic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate pupil
   responsiveness in diabetic subjects with and without cardiovascular
   autonomic neuropathy (CAN) using dynamic pupillometry in two sets of
   experiments.
   Methods: During the first experiment, one flash was administered and the
   pupil response was recorded for 3 s. In the second experiment, 25
   flashes at 1-s interval were administered and the pupil response was
   recorded for 30 s. Several time and pupil-iris radius-related parameters
   were computed from the acquired data. A total of 24 diabetic subjects
   (16 without and 8 with CAN) and 16 healthy volunteers took part in the
   study.
   Results: Our results show that diabetic subjects with and without CAN
   have sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, evidenced by
   diminished amplitude reflexes and significant smaller pupil radius. It
   suggests that pupillary autonomic dysfunction occurs before a more
   generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, and this could
   be used to detect early autonomic dysfunction.
   Conclusions: Dynamic pupillometry provides a simple, inexpensive, and
   noninvasive tool to screen high-risk diabetic patients for diabetic
   autonomic neuropathy.}},

   polymorphisms that span a 19.6-kb genomic region, and obesity was
   therefore evaluated in the biracial population-based Atherosclerosis
   Risk in Communities Study with the goal of further refining the
   association by comparing results between the two ethnic groups. The
   prevalence of diabetes and obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) was established
   at baseline, and diabetes was determined by either self-report, a
   fasting glucose level >= 126 mg/dL, or non-fasting glucose >= 200 mg/dL.
   There were 1,004 diabetes cases and 10,038 non-cases in whites, and 670
   cases and 2,780 non-cases in African-Americans. Differences in mean BMI
   were assessed by a general linear model, and multivariable logistic
   regression was used to predict the risk of diabetes and obesity. For
   white participants, the FTO rs9939609 A allele was associated with an
   increased risk of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, p < 0.001) and
   obesity (OR = 1.22, p < 0.001) under an additive genetic model that was
   similar for all of the SNPs analyzed. In African-Americans, only the
   rs1421085 C allele was a determinant of obesity risk (OR = 1.17, p =
   0.05), but was found to be protective against diabetes (OR = 0.79, p =
   0.03). Adjustment for BMI did not eliminate any of the observed
   associations with diabetes. Significant statistical interaction between
   race and the FTO variants suggests that the effect on diabetes
   susceptibility may be context dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused
   by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few
   methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical
   environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot
   Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological
   data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner
   analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS).
   Methods and Findings: We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses
   associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for
   T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration >= 126 mg/dL. We
   utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006.
   Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic
   regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI),
   ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS,
   multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were
   validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for
   the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three
   combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p<0.001),
   and the vitamin c-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p<0.001). Higher
   concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170
   (adjusted OR 2.2; p<0.001) were also found. Protective factors
   associated with T2D included b-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p<0.001).
   Conclusions and Significance: Despite difficulty in ascertaining
   causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated
   with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the
   broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study
   based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors
   can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by
   GWAS.}},

Abstract = {{Acupuncture (ACU) is known to be effective in ischemia treatment, and
   glutamate (GLU) excitotoxicity is an important factor in neuronal cell
   death. We observed the effect of ACU on cerebral blood flow (\%CBF) and
   Delta GLU (the changes in GLU release) in the ischemic stroke rat model
   of diabetic mellitus (DM). A global ischemia was induced using the
   eleven-vessel occlusion (11-VO) method in 14 Sprague-Dawley rats (DM),
   which were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the
   ACU-treatment group. Extracellular Delta GLU was assessed using an
   intra-cerebral biosensor system measuring 256 samples per second,
   simultaneously with \%CBF and electroencephalogram. ACU stimulation was
   applied to ACU points GB34 and GB39 during the ischemic period.
   Twenty-three diagnostic parameters were proposed first for a detailed
   analysis of changes in \%CBF and GLU release during
   ischemia/reperfusion. ACU rats showed a significant decrease in ischemic
   (p < 0.05) and reperfusion \%CBF (p < 0.0001) than control rats, and a
   significantly larger decrease in ischemic Delta GLU (p < 0.05) and peak
   level of reperfusion Delta GLU (p < 0.005) than control rats. From these
   results, we suggest that ACU stimulation is responsible for the
   potential protection of neurons through suppression of \%CBF response in
   the increased plasma osmolality and extracellular Delta GLU in diabetic
   rats under ischemic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a
   strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying
   mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the
   pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated
   animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases.
   We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic
   mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain
   pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive
   dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in
   double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed
   cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely,
   the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared
   with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could
   aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe
   glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore,
   high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice
   without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created
   Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction.
   Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might
   play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide
   insights into this intensely debated association.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The gastrointestinal hormone GIP promotes pancreatic islet
   function and exerts pro-survival actions on cultured beta-cells.
   However, GIP also promotes lipogenesis, thus potentially restricting its
   therapeutic use. The current studies evaluated the effects of a
   truncated GIP analog, D-Ala(2)-GIP(1-30) (D-GIP(1-30)), on glucose
   homeostasis and beta-cell mass in rat models of diabetes.
   Materials and Methods: The insulinotropic and pro-survival potency of
   D-GIP(1-30) was evaluated in perfused pancreas preparations and cultured
   INS-1 beta-cells, respectively, and receptor selectivity evaluated using
   wild type and GIP receptor knockout mice. Effects of D-GIP(1-30) on
   beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis, in vivo, were determined
   using Lean Zucker rats, obese Vancouver diabetic fatty rats,
   streptozotocin treated rats, and obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats, with
   effects on beta-cell mass determined in histological studies of
   pancreatic tissue. Lipogenic effects of D-GIP(1-30) were evaluated on
   cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
   Results: Acutely, D-GIP(1-30) improved glucose tolerance and insulin
   secretion. Chronic treatment with D-GIP(1-30) reduced levels of islet
   pro-apoptotic proteins in Vancouver diabetic fatty rats and preserved
   beta-cell mass in streptozotocin treated rats and Zucker diabetic fatty
   rats, resulting in improved insulin responses and glycemic control in
   each animal model, with no change in body weight. In in vitro studies,
   D-GIP(1-30) exhibited equivalent potency to GIP(1-42) on beta-cell
   function and survival, but greatly reduced action on lipoprotein lipase
   activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that truncated forms of GIP
   exhibit potent anti-diabetic actions, without pro-obesity effects, and
   that the C-terminus contributes to the lipogenic actions of GIP.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent tight blood sugar control in critically ill patients has
   proven elusive. Properly accounting for the saturation of insulin action
   and reducing the need for frequent measurements are important aspects in
   intensive insulin therapy. This paper presents a composite metabolic
   model, `Glucosafe', that integrates models and parameters from normal
   physiology and accounts for the reduced rate of glucose gut absorption
   and saturation of insulin action in patients with reduced insulin
   sensitivity. Particularly, two different sites of reduced insulin
   sensitivity, before and after the non-linearity of insulin action, are
   explored with this model. These approaches are assessed based on the
   model's accuracy in retrospectively predicting blood glucose
   measurements of 10 randomly chosen, hyperglycemic intensive care
   patients. For each patient, median absolute percent error is <25\% for
   prediction times <= 270 min and modelling reduced insulin sensitivity
   after the non-linearity, compared to <29\% for modelling reduced insulin
   sensitivity before the non-linearity. Scaling the insulin effect (after
   the non-linearity) is a suitable assumption in this model structure.
   These results are preliminary and subject to further and more extensive
   validation of the model's capability to predict the longer term (>2 h)
   blood glucose excursion in critically ill patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel combination of iterative learning control (ILC) and model
   predictive control (MPC), referred to here as model predictive iterative
   learning control (MPILC), is proposed for glycemic control in type 1
   diabetes mellitus. MPILC exploits two key factors: frequent glucose
   readings made possible by continuous glucose monitoring technology; and
   the repetitive nature of glucose-meal-insulin dynamics with a 24-h
   cycle. The proposed algorithm can learn from an individual's lifestyle,
   allowing the control performance to be improved from day to day. After
   less than 10 days, the blood glucose concentrations can be kept within a
   range of 90-170 mg/dL. Generally, control performance under MPILC is
   better than that under MPC. The proposed methodology is robust to random
   variations in meal timings within +/-60 min or meal amounts within
   +/-75\% of the nominal value, which validates MPILC's superior
   robustness compared to run-to-run control. Moreover, to further improve
   the algorithm's robustness, an automatic scheme for setpoint update that
   ensures safe convergence is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method
   does not require user intervention; hence, the algorithm should be of
   particular interest for glycemic control in children and adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in morphology of the skin are an important factor that can
   affect non-invasive measurements performed through this organ, in
   particular for glucose monitoring in e. g. patients with diabetes

   of the superficial skin layers can be beneficial for evaluation of the
   performance of such measurement systems. We applied a full-field optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) system followed by the fully automatic
   processing for this task. With the developed procedure, non-invasive
   quantification of the skin morphology can be performed within a few
   minutes. The dorsal skin of the upper arm of 22 patients with Type 1
   Diabetes Mellitus was investigated with an OCT system and with a
   commercially available dermatological laser scanning confocal microscope
   (CM) as a reference method. The estimates of epidermal thickness from
   OCT were compared with the results of expert-assisted analysis of
   confocal images. The highest correlation with the CM measurements has
   been obtained for the distance from the entrance peak to the first
   minimum of the OCT reflection profile ((R) over bar (2) = 0.657, p <

   negatively correlated with age with marginal statistical significance (p

   develop retinopathy. The proposed system is able to store a wealth of
   information regarding the clinical state of the T1DM patient and
   continuously provide the health experts with predictions regarding the
   possible future complications that he may present. The DSS is a hybrid
   infrastructure combining a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a
   Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Rule Induction C5.0
   classifier, with an improved Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network (iHWNN). A
   voting mechanism is utilized to merge the results from the four
   classification models. The proposed DSS has been trained and evaluated
   using data from 55 T1DM patients, acquired by the Athens Hippokration
   Hospital in close collaboration with the EURODIAB research team. The DSS
   has shown an excellent performance resulting in an accuracy of 98\%.
   Care has been taken to design and implement a consistent and
   continuously evolving Information Technology (IT) system by utilizing
   technologies such as smart agents periodically triggered to retrain the
   DSS with new cases added in the data repository.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a prediction algorithm for blood glucose in Type 2
   diabetes. An iPhone application was developed that allows patients to
   record their daily blood glucose levels and provide them with relevant
   feedback using the prediction algorithm to help control their blood
   glucose levels. Several methods using theoretical functions were tested
   to select the most accurate prediction method. The prediction is
   adjusted with each glucose reading input by the patient taking into
   consideration the time of the glucose reading and the time after the
   patient's last meal, as well as any physical activity. The
   individualized prediction algorithm was tested and verified with real
   patient data and also validated using a non-parametric regression
   method. The accuracy of prediction results varied from different
   approaches and was adequate for most of the methods tested. The
   predicted results merged closer to the patients' actual glucose readings
   after each additional input reading. The findings of the research were
   encouraging and the predictive system provided what we believe to be
   helpful feedback to control, improve, and take proactive measures to
   regulate blood glucose levels.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by a
   lack of insulin, insulin resistance, or both. There is increasing
   evidence that insulin also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as
   it is involved in the metabolism of beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau, two
   proteins that form A beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs),
   respectively, the hallmark lesions in AD. Here, we examined the effects
   of experimental DM on a pre-existing tau pathology in the pR5 transgenic
   mouse strain that is characterized by NFTs. pR5 mice express P301L
   mutant human tau that is associated with dementia. Experimental DM was
   induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which causes insulin
   deficiency. We determined phosphorylation of tau, using
   immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Solubility of tau was
   determined upon extraction with sarkosyl and formic acid, and Gallyas
   silver staining was employed to reveal NFTs. Insulin depletion by STZ
   administration in six months-old non-transgenic mice causes increased
   tau phosphorylation, without its deposition or NFT formation. In
   contrast, in pR5 mice this results in massive deposition of
   hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau. Furthermore, they develop a
   pronounced tau-histopathology, including NFTs at this early age, while
   the pathology in sham-treated pR5 mice is moderate. Whereas experimental
   DM did not result in deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in
   non-transgenic mice, a predisposition to develop a tau pathology in
   young pR5 mice was both sufficient and necessary to exacerbate tau
   deposition and NFT formation. Hence, DM can accelerate onset and
   increase severity of disease in individuals with a predisposition to
   developing tau pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Semiparametric models are becoming increasingly attractive for
   longitudinal data analysis. often there is lack of knowledge of the
   covariance structure of the response variable. Although it is still
   possible to obtain consistent estimators for both parametric and
   nonparametric components of a semipatrametric model by assuming an
   identity structure for the covariance matrix, the resulting estimators
   may not be efficient. We conducted extensive simulation studies to
   investigate the impact of an unknown covariance structure on estimators
   in semiparametric models for longitudinal data. In some situations the
   loss of efficiency could be substantial. A two-step estimator is thus
   proposed to improve the efficiency. Our study was motivated by a

Abstract = {{Backround: A meta-analysis combining results from three genome-wide
   association studies and followed by large-scale replication identified
   six novel type 2 diabetes loci. Subsequent studies of the effect of
   these variants on estimates of the beta-cell function and insulin
   sensitivity have been inconclusive. We examined these variants located
   in or near the JAZF1 (rs864745), THADA (rs7578597), TSPAN8 (rs7961581),
   ADAMTS9 (rs4607103), NOTCH2 (rs10923931) and the CDC123/CAMK1D
   (rs12779790) genes for associations with measures of pancreatic
   beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.
   Methodology/Results: Oral and intravenous glucose stimulated insulin
   release (n=849) and insulin sensitivity (n=596) estimated from a
   hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were measured in non-diabetic
   offspring of type 2 diabetic patients from five European populations.
   Assuming an additive genetic model the diabetes-associated major
   C-allele of rs4607103 near ADAMTS9 associated with reduced
   insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p=0.002) during a hyperinsulinemic
   euglycemic clamp. However, following intravenous and oral administration
   of glucose serum insulin release was increased in individuals with the
   C-allele (p=0.003 and p=0.01, respectively). A meta-analyse combining
   clamp and IVGTT data from a total of 905 non-diabetic individuals showed
   that the C-risk allele associated with decreased insulin sensitivity
   (p=0.003) and increased insulin release (p=0.002). The major T-allele of
   the intronic JAZF1 rs864745 conferring increased diabetes risk was
   associated with increased 2(nd) phase serum insulin release during an
   IVGTT (p=0.03), and an increased fasting serum insulin level (p=0.001).
   The remaining variants did not show any associations with insulin
   response, insulin sensitivity or any other measured quantitative traits.
   Conclusion: The present studies suggest that the diabetogenic impact of
   the C-allele of rs4607103 near ADAMTS9 may in part be mediated through
   decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory burden is high in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients.
   In Diabetic ESRD patients, the balance between pro- and anti-oxidant
   activities is shifted towards an oxidative stress. Myeloperoxidase
   (MPO), a bactericidal enzyme plays an active role in induction and
   evolution of the endothelial dysfunction associated with Type 2 Diabetes
   Mellitus (DM). However, whether MPO can serve as a marker in diabetic
   ESRD patients is doubtful. Hence, the present study was undertaken. The
   Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
   and Serum Myeloperoxidase levels were estimated in three different
   groups with 30 subjects each. The Control group includes healthy
   individuals, group I constitutes Type 2 diabetes with no nephropathy and
   group II includes Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy patients. Glomerular
   Filtration Rate (GFR) was calculated using Cockcroft Gault formula
   corrected for the Body Surface Area. Statistical software, namely, SPSS
   15.0, Stata 8.0, MedCalc 9.0.1 and Systat 11.0 were used for the
   analysis of the data and Microsoft word and Excel have been used to
   generate graphs, tables etc. Reference Ranges for MPO were established
   in our study. An increase in MPO levels was noticed in Group I, whereas
   a differential behaviour of MPO levels was noted in group II. Uremic
   diabetic nephropathy patients with a low MPO level may be at a lesser
   risk for any cardiac event compared to those uremic patients with high
   MPO levels. Hence, MPO may be taken as a biomarker to predict coronary

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To evaluate the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin therapy on
   bone density around osseointegrated dental implants by digital
   subtraction radiography (DSR).
   Material and methods
   Forty implants were placed in tibiae of 40 adult rats. After a healing
   period of 2 months, the animals were divided into four groups of 10
   animals each: a 2-month control group, sacrificed at time (A), a
   diabetic group (D), an insulin-treated group (I) and a 4-month control
   group (C). During 2 months, group I received subcutaneous doses of
   insulin, whereas groups C and D received only saline. The animals in
   groups D, I and C were thereafter sacrificed. The glucose plasma levels
   (GPLs) were monitored throughout the experiment. Film radiographs were
   taken at implant surgery and on the day of sacrifice. The radiographs
   were digitized, and bone density in regions of osseointegration (OR)
   around the implants was evaluated by quantitative DSR between baseline
   and final images. Differences in shades of gray among the groups were
   assessed using ANOVA.
   Results
   GPLs were within normal range for groups A, C and I and higher for group
   D. There was a significant difference in mean gray shade values in the
   OR of subtraction images between groups D (122 +/- 7) and I (136 +/- 5)
   (P < 0.05) while there were no significant differences between control
   groups A (128 +/- 13) and C (134 +/- 10) and the insulin group I.
   Conclusions
   DM impaired bone density around osseointegrated dental implant. Further,
   insulin therapy maintained bone density in diabetic rats.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case-based decision support system prototype to
   assist patients with Type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. These
   patients must vigilantly maintain blood glucose levels within prescribed
   target ranges to prevent serious disease complications, including
   blindness, neuropathy, and heart failure. Case-based reasoning (CBR) was
   selected for this domain because (a) existing guidelines for managing
   diabetes are general and must be tailored to individual patient needs;
   (b) physical and lifestyle factors combine to influence blood glucose
   levels; and (c) CBR has been successfully applied to the management of
   other long-term medical conditions. An institutional review board (IRB)
   approved preliminary clinical study, involving 20 patients, was
   conducted to assess the feasibility of providing case-based decision
   support for these patients. Fifty cases were compiled in a case library,
   situation assessment routines were encoded to detect common problems in
   blood glucose control, and retrieval metrics were developed to find the
   most relevant past cases for solving current problems. Preliminary
   results encourage continued research and work toward development of a
   practical tool for patients.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for
   providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions
   and lower access to care.
   Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention
   to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse,
   medically underserved patients with diabetes.
   Design, Setting, and Patients: A randomized controlled trial was
   conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with
   blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes,
   aged 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved
   areas of New York State.
   Interventions: Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus
   usual care.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of
   follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL)
   cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.
   Results: Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine
   achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the
   primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences
   (95\% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)\% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08,
   7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for
   systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3,74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There
   were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care
   group (hazard ratio 1.01 {[}0.82, 1.24]).
   Conclusions: Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements
   in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in
   medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not
   different between the groups, although power was limited.}},

Title = {{Adding Pioglitazone to Insulin Containing Regimens in Type 2 Diabetes:
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Type 2 diabetes is treated in a stepwise manner, progressing
   from diet and physical activity to oral antidiabetic agents and insulin.
   The oral agent pioglitazone is licensed for use with insulin when
   metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. This systematic review
   and meta-analysis investigates the extent to which adding pioglitazone
   to insulin-containing regimens produces benefits in terms of
   patient-relevant outcomes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane
   Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing
   pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in
   comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2
   diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight,
   and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised
   according to standard systematic review methodology and in a
   meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of
   adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092
   patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with
   previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12
   weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45
   mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58\%
   (95\% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p<0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly
   more frequent in the pioglitazone arms ( relative risk 1.27; 95\% CI:
   0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be
   increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain
   more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of
   almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone
   groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on
   cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too
   short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes.
   Conclusions/Significance: When added to insulin regimens, pioglitazone
   confers a small advantage in terms of HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients
   with previous inadequate glucose control, but at the cost of increased
   hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Other considerations include the risk of
   heart failure, fractures in women, a reduced insulin dose, and the net
   financial cost.}},

Abstract = {{Xenotransplantation of pig tissues has great potential to overcome the
   shortage of organ donors. One approach to address the vigorous immune
   rejection associated with xenotransplants is the use of embryonic
   precursor tissue, which induces and utilizes host vasculature upon its
   growth and development. Recently, we showed in mice that embryonic pig
   pancreatic tissue from embryonic day 42 (E42) exhibits optimal
   properties as a beta cell replacement therapy. We now demonstrate the
   proof of concept in 2 diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys, followed for 393 and
   280 days, respectively. A marked reduction of exogenous insulin
   requirement was noted by the fourth month after transplantation,
   reaching complete independence from exogenous insulin during the fifth
   month after transplantation, with full physiological control of blood
   glucose levels. The porcine origin of insulin was documented by a
   radioimmunoassay specific for porcine C-peptide. Furthermore, the
   growing tissue was found to be predominantly vascularized with host
   blood vessels, thereby evading hyperacute or acute rejection, which
   could potentially be mediated by preexisting anti-pig antibodies.
   Durable graft protection was achieved, and most of the late
   complications could be attributed to the immunosuppressive protocol.
   While fine tuning of immune suppression, tissue dose, and implantation
   techniques are still required, our results demonstrate that porcine E-42
   embryonic pancreatic tissue can normalize blood glucose levels in
   primates. Its long-term proliferative capacity, its revascularization by
   host endothelium, and its reduced immunogenicity, strongly suggest that
   this approach could offer an attractive replacement therapy for
   diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) was a randomized
   controlled trial, which showed that it is possible to prevent type 2
   diabetes by lifestyle changes. The aim of the present study was to
   examine whether the lifestyle intervention had an effect on the ten-year
   mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in the DPS participants
   originally randomized either into an intervention or control group.
   Furthermore, we compared these results with a population-based cohort
   comprising individuals of varying glucose tolerance states.
   Methods and Findings: Middle-aged, overweight people with IGT (n=522)
   were randomized into intensive intervention (including physical
   activity, weight reduction and dietary counseling), or control
   ``mini-intervention{''} group. Median length of the intervention period
   was 4 years and the mean follow-up was 10.6 years. The population-based
   reference study cohort included 1881 individuals (1570 with normal
   glucose tolerance, 183 with IGT, 59 with screen-detected type 2
   diabetes, 69 with previously known type 2 diabetes) with the mean
   follow-up of 13.8 years. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity data
   were collected from the national Hospital Discharge Register and Causes
   of Death Register. Among the DPS participants who consented for register
   linkage (n=505), total mortality (2.2 vs. 3.8 per 1000 person years,
   hazard ratio HR=0.57, 95\% CI 0.21-1.58) and cardiovascular morbidity
   (22.9 vs. 22.0 per 1000 person years, HR=1.04, 95\% CI 0.72-1.51) did
   not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups.
   Compared with the population-based cohort with impaired glucose
   tolerance, adjusted HRs were 0.21 (95\% CI 0.09-0.52) and 0.39 (95\% CI
   0.20-0.79) for total mortality, and 0.89 (95\% CI 0.62-1.27) and 0.87
   (0.60-1.27) for cardiovascular morbidity in the intervention and control
   groups of the DPS, respectively. The risk of death in DPS combined
   cohort was markedly lower than in FINRISK IGT cohort (adjusted HR 0.30,
   95\% CI 0.17-0.54), but there was no significant difference in the risk
   of CVD (adjusted HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.64-1.21).
   Conclusions: Lifestyle intervention among persons with IGT did not
   decrease cardiovascular morbidity during the first 10 years of
   follow-up. However, the statistical power may not be sufficient to
   detect small differences between the intervention and control groups.
   Low total mortality among participants of the DPS compared with
   individuals with IGT in the general population could be ascribed to a
   lower cardiovascular risk profile at baseline and regular follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but gene

   receptor (IR). Doxycycline (DOX) treatment of the resulting transgenic
   rats led to a dose-dependent and reversible increase in blood glucose
   caused by ubiquitous inhibition of IR expression and signalling. We
   could neither detect an interferon response nor disturbances in microRNA
   processing after DOX treatment excluding toxic effects of shRNA
   expression. Low dose DOX treatment induced a chronic state of diabetes
   mellitus. In conclusion, we have developed a technology which allows the
   specific, inducible, and reversible suppression of any gene of interest

Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two
   of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition,
   obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea
   syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism.
   However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe
   SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional
   case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are
   more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic
   women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and
   smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a
   university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory
   disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease,
   alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a
   non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an
   awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the
   percentage of time spent at saturations below 90\% (CT90). A high
   prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM: 80\%, nondiabetic:
   78.3\%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events
   between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in
   diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected
   (20.2 +/- 30.2\% vs. 6.8 +/- 13,5\%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual
   volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted:
   79.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 100.1 +/- 22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression
   analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with
   CT90.
   Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep,
   becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in
   obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular
   disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Observational studies suggested an association between
   diabetes and the risk of various geriatric conditions (i.e., cognitive
   impairment, dementia, depression, mobility impairment, disability,
   falls, and urinary incontinence). However, the magnitude and impact of
   diabetes on older adults have not been reviewed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: MEDLINE and PSYCINFO databases were
   searched through November 2007 for published studies, supplemented by
   manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Population-based,
   prospective cohort studies that reported risk of geriatric outcomes in
   relation to diabetes status at baseline were selected. Two authors
   independently extracted the data, including study population and
   follow-up duration, ascertainment of diabetes status at baseline,
   outcomes of interest and their ascertainment, adjusted covariates,
   measures of association, and brief results. Fifteen studies examined the
   association of DM with cognitive dysfunction. DM was associated with a
   faster decline in cognitive function among older adults. The pooled
   adjusted risk ratio (RR) for all dementia when persons with DM were
   compared to those without was 1.47 (95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.73). Summary RRs
   for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia comparing persons with DM
   to those without were 1.39 (CI, 1.16 to 1.66) and 2.38 (CI, 1.79 to
   3.18), respectively. Four of 5 studies found significant association of
   DM with faster mobility decline and incident disability. Two studies
   examined the association of diabetes with falls in older women. Both
   found statistically significant associations. Insulin users had higher
   RR for recurrent falls. One study for urinary incontinence in older
   women found statistically significant associations. Two studies for
   depression did not suggest that DM was an independent predictor of
   incident depression.
   Conclusions/Significance: Current evidence supports that DM is
   associated with increased risk for selected geriatric conditions.
   Clinicians should increase their awareness and provide appropriate care.
   Future research is required to elucidate the underlying pathological
   pathway.}},

   Since data are recorded in different time with variable sampling period,
   a flexible time series analysis method is presented for exploiting

   based on domain specific language to extract chronic disease care
   knowledge from nursing records. Finally, a health surveillance system is
   developed by integrating multi-modal daily caring information for
   long-term caring of chronic patients. Several experiments with

Abstract = {{The chronic disease diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. It is
   caused by absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, and is associated
   with a range of severe complications including renal and cardiovascular
   disease as well as blindness. Preventive care helps in controlling the
   severity of this disease, however, preventive measures require correct
   educational awareness and routine health checks. Medical doctors help in
   effective diagnosis as well as treatment of diabetes, although it is
   associated with high costs. With this view, the purpose of the present
   research is to develop a low-cost automated knowledge-based system that
   helps in self-diagnosis and management of this chronic disease for
   patients as well as doctors. Our knowledge-based system has an easy
   computer interface, which performs the diagnostic tasks using rules
   acquired from medical doctors on the basis of patient data. At present
   our system consists of 26 rules and it has been implemented using Prolog
   programming. Some real-life experimentations were performed, which

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that an elevated serum ferritin concentration is
   considered an independent factor associated with increased risk of type
   2 diabetes, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is inversely associated
   with diabetes.
   The cross-sectional study investigates 6,230 participants' data from the
   Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, The Cooper Institute (Dallas,
   Texas). The authors explored whether CRF level is associated inversely
   with lower serum ferritin concentration and is associated with a lower
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes.
   Participants with high ferritin levels and high triglyceride were 1.89
   and 1.57 times, respectively, more likely to have diabetes. Overweight
   or obese individuals were 1.35 to 1.40 times more likely to have
   diabetes. Participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes were
   3.96 times more likely to have diabetes.
   Lower serum ferritin concentration was associated with lower risk of
   diabetes in those participating in cardiorespiratory fitness. It
   suggests that physicians may use patients' ferritin concentrations as a
   marker for predicting their risk for new-onset diabetes, and patients
   should be encouraged to participate in cardiorespiratory fitness or
   physical activities.}},

Abstract = {{Good blood glucose control is important to people with type 1 diabetes
   to prevent diabetes-related complications. Too much blood glucose
   (hyperglycaemia) causes long-term micro-vascular complications, while a
   severe drop in blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) can cause life-threatening
   coma. Finding the right balance between quantity and type of food
   intake, physical activity levels and insulin dosage, is a daily
   challenge. Increased physical activity levels often cause changes in
   blood glucose due to increased glucose uptake into tissues such as
   muscle. To date we have limited knowledge about the minute by minute
   effects of exercise on blood glucose levels, in part due to the
   difficulty in measuring glucose and physical activity levels
   continuously, in a free-living environment. By using a light and
   user-friendly armband we can record physical activity energy expenditure
   on a minute-by-minute basis. Simultaneously, by using a continuous
   glucose monitoring system we can record glucose concentrations. In this
   paper, Gaussian Processes are used to model the glucose excursions in
   response to physical activity data, to study its effect on glycaemic
   control.}},

Abstract = {{METABO is a diabetes monitoring and management system which aims at
   recording and interpreting patient's context, as well as, at providing
   decision support to both the patient and the doctor. The METABO system
   consists of (a) a Patient's Mobile Device (PMD), (b) different types of
   unobtrusive biosensors, (c) a Central Subsystem (CS) located remotely at
   the hospital and (d) the Control Panel (CP) from which physicians can
   follow-up their patients and gain also access to the CS. METABO provides
   a multi-parametric monitoring system which facilitates the efficient and
   systematic recording of dietary, physical activity, medication and
   medical information (continuous and discontinuous glucose measurements).
   Based on all recorded contextual information, data mining schemes that
   run in the PMD are responsible to model patients' metabolism, predict
   hypo/hyper-glycaemic events, and provide the patient with short and
   long-term alerts. In addition, all past and recently-recorded data are
   analyzed to extract patterns of behavior, discover new knowledge and
   provide explanations to the physician through the CP. Advanced tools in
   the CP allow the physician to prescribe personalized treatment plans and
   frequently quantify patient's adherence to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mobile technologies for self-monitoring of blood glucose and
   blood pressure for diabetes patients is becoming increasingly popular
   worldwide. This is propelled by the proliferation of the wider usage of
   mobile phones and other wireless technologies and computing platforms in
   the healthcare sector. Such technologies can play a pivotal role in
   chronic disease management and patient self-care. There have been
   several clinical trials in recent years on mobile diabetes management in
   UK and Canada. However, no studies to date have addressed and correlated
   the technological and clinical outcomes concerning the use of mobile
   chronic disease management systems for diabetes from the UK and Canadian
   perspectives. In this paper we address some of these correlative issues
   based on similar clinical trials on mobile type-2 diabetes management
   systems deployed in these two countries. In particular, the outcomes of
   these trials supported the use of telemonitoring for effective blood
   pressure control, but telemonitoring was less effective at managing
   blood glucose control. Some of the clinical results and challenges are
   presented together with future work and suggestions that aim to validate
   a generic platform for mobile diabetes management.}},

   patients controlled subcutaneously by an insulin pump. Two versions of
   the minimal model are used: the nonlinear classic minimal model
   developed by Bergman et al. (MM) and the linear approximation proposed
   by Fernandez et al. (LMM). All data windows (n = 13) show residuals that
   are correlated for both the LMM and MM (p-value < 0.01). The results
   also show that both the LMM and MM provide an equivalent goodness of fit
   with R-2 C values that are statistically equivalent (p-value > 0.05).
   This study confirms that the minimal model of glucose disappearance,
   either the classic or linear version, is unable to describe the observed
   experimental data possibly as a result of the physiological constraints
   imposed by the minimal model approach on the system dynamics, together
   with possible errors derived from the unmeasured insulin dynamics.
   Further testing on more complex models should be performed.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Maintaining
   tight glycemic control is essential to prevent microvascular and
   macrovascular complications as demonstrated by many studies. Current
   recommendation for HbAlc is less then 7\% and even 6.5\% in special
   individuals. HbAlc measurement is considered the gold standard of
   diabetes care and serves as a surrogate of diabetes-related
   complications, but it does not provide information about glycemic
   excursions. For these reasons, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
   levels is considered an important adjunct to HbAlc measurements for
   achieving and maintaining glycemic control and consequently for reducing
   diabetes-related complications. A new method that offers us a complete
   investigation of glucose excursions is continuous glucose monitoring
   system (CGMS) that measure glucose concentration in subcutaneous
   interstitial fluid which can reflect changes in blood glucose
   concentrations reasonably quickly every 5 min throughout 72 hours (3
   days).
   The aim of this paper was to evaluate the different methods of assessing
   glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus and to compare
   themselves in order to establish the clinical relevance. We assessed the
   glycemic control by HbA1c, SMBG and CGMS Gold simultaneously in a number
   of 97 individuals with diabetes. 20 individuals have a HbAlc between 6,5
   - 7,4\%, 33 patients between 7,5 - 8,4\%, 15 between 8,5-9,4\%, 10
   between 9,5 - 10,5\% and 7 persons more than 10,5\%. It was observed
   that between HbAlc level and the period spent in glycemic values more
   than 180 mg/di there is not a direct relationship as we expected. The
   same trend was observed in near normal glycemic status but in different
   way.
   Assessing of glycemia in diabetes is crucially important to the
   prevention of both acute and long - term complications. The 3
   fundamental approaches to assessment, HbAlc, SMBG and CGM provide
   fundamentally different but complementary information.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) provides a
   link between cytokine action and their negative consequences on insulin
   signalling. Thus SOCS3 is a potential candidate gene for type 2 diabetes
   (T2DM).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on HapMap we identified the
   polymorphism A+930 -> G (rs4969168) as a haplotype tagging SNP (htSNP)
   sufficiently covering the genetic variation of the whole gene. We
   therefore examined the association between rs4969168 within SOCS3 and
   T2DM in three independent study populations; one prospective case-cohort
   study and two cross-sectional study populations. Due to the low
   frequency of individuals being homozygous for the polymorphism a
   dominant model of inheritance was assumed. The case-cohort study with
   2,957 individuals (764 of them with incident T2DM) showed no effect of
   the polymorphism on diabetes risk (hazard ratio (95\%Cl): 0.86
   (0.66-1.13); p = 0.3). Within the MeSyBePo-study population 325 subjects
   had T2DM from a total of 1,897 individuals, while the second
   cross-sectional cohort included 851 cases of T2DM within a total of 1653
   subjects. According to the results in the prospective study, no
   association with T2DM was found (odds ratio (95\%Cl): 0.78 (0.54-1.12)
   for MesyBepo and 1.13 (0.90-1.42) for the Leipzig study population).
   There was also no association with metabolic subtraits such as insulin
   sensitivity (p = 0.7), insulin secretion (p = 0.8) or the hyperbolic
   relation of both, the disposition index (p = 0.7). In addition, no
   evidence for interaction with BMI or sex was found. We subsequently
   performed a meta-analysis, additionally including the publicly available
   data from the T2DM-subcohort of the WTCCC (n = 4,855). The overall odds
   ratio within that meta-analysis was 0.96 (0.88-1.06).
   Conclusions/Significance: There is no strong effect of the common
   genetic variation within the SOCS3 gene on the development of T2DM.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite intensive insulin treatment, many patients with
   type-1 diabetes (T1DM) have longstanding inadequate glycaemic control.
   Metformin is an oral hypoglycaemic agent that improves insulin action in
   patients with type-2 diabetes. We investigated the effect of a one-year
   treatment with metformin versus placebo in patients with T1DM and
   persistent poor glycaemic control.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: One hundred patients with T1DM,
   preserved hypoglycaemic awareness and HaemoglobinA(1c) (HbA(1c)) >=
   8.5\% during the year before enrolment entered a one-month run-in on
   placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to
   treatment with either metformin (1 g twice daily) or placebo for 12
   months (double-masked). Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and
   their usual outpatient clinical care. The primary outcome measure was
   change in HbA(1c) after one year of treatment. At enrolment, mean
   (standard deviation) HbA(1c) was 9.48\% (0.99) for the metformin group
   (n=49) and 9.60\% (0.86) for the placebo group (n=51). Mean (95\%
   confidence interval) baseline-adjusted differences after 12 months with
   metformin (n=48) versus placebo (n=50) were: HbA(1c), 0.13\% (-0.19;
   0.44), p=0.422; Total daily insulin dose, -5.7 U/day (-8.6; -2.9), p <
   0.001; body weight, -1.74 kg (-3.32; -0.17), p=0.030. Minor and overall
   major hypoglycaemia was not significantly different between treatments.
   Treatments were well tolerated.
   Conclusions/Significance: In patients with poorly controlled T1DM,
   adjunct metformin therapy did not provide any improvement of glycaemic
   control after one year. Nevertheless, adjunct metformin treatment was
   associated with sustained reductions of insulin dose and body weight.
   Further investigations into the potential cardiovascular-protective
   effects of metformin therapy in patients with T1DM are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Data can be classified according to their properties. Classification is
   implemented by developing a model with existing records by using sample
   data. One of the aims of classification is to increase the reliability
   of the results obtained from the data. Fuzzy and crisp values are used
   together in medical data. Regarding to this, a new method is presented
   for classification of data of a medical database in this study. Also a
   hybrid neural network that includes artificial neural network (ANN) and
   fuzzy neural network (FNN) was developed. Two real-time problem data
   were investigated for determining the applicability of the proposed
   method. The data were obtained from the University of California at
   Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The datasets are Pima Indians
   diabetes and Cleveland heart disease. In order to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method accuracy, sensitivity and specificity
   performance measures that are used commonly in medical classification
   studies were used. The classification accuracies of these datasets were
   obtained by k-fold cross-validation. The proposed method achieved
   accuracy values 84.24\% and 86.8\% for Pima Indians diabetes dataset and
   Cleveland heart disease dataset, respectively. It has been observed that

Abstract = {{Background: Current gene- and cell-based therapies have significant
   limitations which impede widespread clinical application. Taking
   diabetes mellitus as a paradigm, we have sought to overcome these
   limitations by ex vivo electrotransfer of a nonviral insulin expression
   vector into primary hepatocytes followed by immediate autologous
   reimplantation in a preclinical model of diabetes.
   Methods and Results: In a single 3-hour procedure, hepatocytes were
   isolated from a surgically resected liver wedge, electroporated with an
   insulin expression plasmid ex vivo and reimplanted intraparenchymally
   under ultrasonic guidance into the liver in each of 10
   streptozotocin-induced diabetic Yorkshire pigs. The vector was comprised
   of a bifunctional, glucose-responsive promoter linked to human insulin
   cDNA. Ambient glucose concentrations appropriately altered human insulin
   mRNA expression and C-peptide secretion within minutes in vitro and in
   vivo. Treated swine showed correction of hyperglycemia, glucose
   intolerance, dyslipidemia and other metabolic abnormalities for >= 47
   weeks. Metabolic correction correlated significantly with the number of
   hepatocytes implanted. Importantly, we observed no hypoglycemia even
   under fasting conditions. Direct intrahepatic implantation of
   hepatocytes did not alter biochemical indices of liver function or
   induce abnormal hepatic lobular architecture. About 70\% of implanted
   hepatocytes functionally engrafted, appeared histologically normal,
   retained vector DNA and expressed human insulin for >= 47 weeks. Based
   on structural tissue analyses and transcriptome data, we showed that
   early correction of diabetes attenuated and even prevented pathological
   changes in the eye, kidney, liver and aorta.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that autologous hepatocytes can be
   efficiently, simply and safely modified by electroporation of a nonviral
   vector to express, process and secrete insulin durably. This strategy,
   which achieved significant and sustained therapeutic efficacy in a large
   preclinical model without adverse effects, warrants consideration for
   clinical development especially as it could have broader future
   applications for the treatment of other acquired and inherited diseases
   for which systemic reconstitution of a specific protein deficiency is
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The mechanisms underlying the associations between QT
   interval duration and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain
   unclear. It has been assumed that these associations are driven by
   abnormal myocardial repolarization. We examined the relationship between
   coronary artery disease, measured by coronary artery calcified plaque
   (CAC), and the duration of QRS, JT, and QT intervals, among
   predominantly type two diabetic participants.
   Methods: The study sample included 1,123 subjects from the Diabetes
   Heart Study, of whom 85\% had type 2 diabetes. Correlations between
   electrocardiogram interval durations and log-transformed coronary artery
   calcified (CAC) were assessed in univariate and sequential multivariable
   generalized estimating equation models adjusted for familial
   correlations, heart rate, age, race, gender, diabetes status,
   hypertension status, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, systolic
   blood pressure, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, QT-prolonging
   medications, and use of exogenous estrogen.
   Results: QT interval duration significantly correlated with the extent
   of CAC in univariate (r = 0.09, P = 0.01) and multivariable models (r =
   0.08, P = 0.01). We observed strong correlations between the QRS
   duration and CAC in univariate (r = 0.23, P < 0.0001) and adjusted
   models (r = 0.10, P = 0.01). In contrast, the JT interval was not
   associated with CAC. A strong correlation existed between the QRS
   interval and CAC in men (QRS: r = 0.24, P <= 0.0001) and diabetics (QRS:
   r = 0.25, P <= 0.0001) but was absent in women and nondiabetics. These
   relationships were not modified by CVD, race, or presence of bundle
   branch block.
   Conclusion: QT duration correlates with the amount of CAC in a
   predominantly diabetic population. The association between QT duration
   and CAC is driven by QRS and not JT interval duration.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted, tight model-based glycemic control in critical care patients
   that can reduce mortality 18-45\% is enabled by prediction of insulin
   sensitivity, S-I. However, this parameter can vary significantly over a
   given hour in the critically ill as their condition evolves. A
   stochastic model of S-I variability is constructed using data from 165
   critical care patients. Given S-I for an hour, the stochastic model
   returns the probability density function of S-I for the next hour.
   Consequently, the glycemic distribution following a known intervention
   can be derived, enabling pre-determined likelihoods of the result and
   more accurate control.
   Cross validation of the S-I variability model shows that 86.6\% of the
   blood glucose measurements are within the 0.90 probability interval, and
   54.0\% are within the interquartile interval. ``Virtual Patients{''}
   with S-I behaving to the overall S-I variability model achieved similar
   predictive performance in simulated trials (86.8\% and 45.7\%). Finally,
   adaptive control method incorporating S-I variability is shown to
   produce improved glycemic control in simulated trials compared to
   current clinical results. The validated stochastic model and methods

Abstract = {{Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; (IDDM) is a chronic disease
   characterized by the inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient
   amounts of Insulin. Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4-6
   insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy
   being to maintain normoglycemia-i.e., a blood glucose level between 4-7
   mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these Injections,
   various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and
   semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a
   therapy. Here, an attempt Is made to show how system identification and
   control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be
   used in design of optimal insulin regimens.
   The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the
   glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The Insulin
   subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the
   subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose
   from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using
   compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several
   black-box modets and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose
   Interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to
   real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were
   encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce
   sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of
   the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed
   models were able to describe the system accurately In all aspects during
   all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics.
   Based on the estimated models, short-term blood glucose predictors for
   up to two-hour-ahead blood glucose prediction were investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to establish the quasi-continuous
   courses, using microdialysis technique, of glucose, lactate, and
   glycerol concentrations in interstitial fluid of abdominal adipose
   tissue during the standard treatment of acute diabetes complications.
   Clinical studies were carried out on 31 diabetic patients during the
   initial 48 h of the treatment. In all but two obese female patients with
   hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) did glucose concentration in
   perfusion fluid (PF) reflect concentration in capillary blood. The
   recovery of glucose correlated with patients' body mass index (r =
   0.55). It was significantly higher in lean and overweight patients (91
   +/- 15\%) than in obese patients (55 +/- 31\%). The course of lactate
   concentration in PF coincided with the course in venous blood (2.1 +/-
   0.3 mmol/L vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, P = 0.35). Glycerol concentration was
   267 +/- 41 mu mol/L and 133 +/- 40 mu mol/L in PF and venous blood,
   respectively (P = 0.004). The study indicated that microdialysis may be
   an effective tool to monitor concentration of different metabolites in
   interstitial fluid of the adipose tissue during treatment of the acute
   complications of diabetes. Applicability of the technique in the
   monitoring of HHS, especially in obese female patients, needs further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to diagnosis of diabetes disease, which is one
   of the most important diseases in medical field using Generalized
   Discriminant Analysis (GDA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine

   Generalized Discriminant Analysis and Least Square Support Vector
   Machine. The proposed system consists of two stages. The first stage, we
   have used Generalized Discriminant Analysis to discriminant feature
   variables between healthy and patient (diabetes) data as pre-processing
   process. The second stage, we have used LS-SVM in order to
   classification of diabetes dataset. While LS-SVM obtained 78.21\%
   classification accuracy using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed
   system called GDA-LS-SVM obtained 82.05\% classification accuracy using
   10-fold cross validation. The robustness of the proposed system is
   examined using classification accuracy, k-fold cross-validation method
   and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 82.05\%

   implemented a prediction system for T2DM, and it employs several
   statistical prediction models. These models are produced by statistical
   analysis about cohort data of Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study
   (KoGES), and include risk factors which are adequate for preventing T2DM
   in Korean populations. The prediction system is written in JSF and Java,
   and developed into web application which is designed through object

   20042009, TEDDY will screen more than 360,000 newborns from both the
   general population and families already affected by T1D to identify an
   estimated 17,804 children with high-risk HLA-DR, DQ genotypes. Of those,
   7,801 (788 first-degree relatives and 7,013 newborns with no family
   history of T1D) will be enrolled in prospective follow-up beginning
   before the age of 4.5 months. As of May 2008, TEDDY has screened more

   70\% of the final cohort. Participants are seen every 3 months up to 4
   years of age, with subsequent visits every 6 months until the subject is
   15 years of age. Blood samples are collected at each visit for detection
   of candidate infectious agents and nutritional biomarkers; monthly stool
   samples are collected for infectious agents. These samples are saved in
   a central repository. Primary endpoints include (1) appearance of one or
   more islet autoantibodies (to insulin, GAD65 or IA-2) confirmed at two
   consecutive visits; (2) development of T1D. By age 15, an estimated 800
   children will develop islet autoimmunity and 400 will progress to T1D;

   diabetes from India. We undertook the MEDI study (Multicenter Survey of
   Early Onset Diabetes in India) to assess the proportion of various
   subtypes of diabetes among the young subjects presenting to the
   endocrinology divisions of seven large teaching hospitals in different
   regions of India. In addition, we compared the clinical features of T1D
   and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Indian subjects. Patients with onset of
   disease at younger than 20 years of age were included in this study. Six
   hundred and three subjects (603) were studied of whom 535 subjects
   (89\%) had T1D, 36 (6\%) had T2D, 18 (3\%) had diabetes related to
   tropical pancreatitis or other forms of chronic pancreatitis, while
   other subtypes accounted for the rest. Compared to those with T2D,
   subjects with T1D were younger, had a lower C-peptide level, higher
   prevalence of ketosis, lower prevalence of acanthosis nigricans, and
   lower LDL and triglyceride levels. When compared with that of T2D, a
   higher proportion of patients with T1D were positive for GAD-65 and IA-2
   antibodies, and this difference was statistically significant for GAD-65
   antibodies. Overall, this large multicenter study showed that T1D is the

Abstract = {{Objectives: INCA (Intelligent Control Assistant for Diabetes) is an EU
   funded project aimed at improving diabetes therapy by creating a
   personal closed-loop system interacting with telemedical remote control.
   This study aims at identifying and applying suitable methods for a
   cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the payor for health
   services.
   Methods: For cost analysis MOSAIK-M was used, a method and tool for
   health information systems analysis and design. Two MOSAIK-M models were
   created describing conventional insulin pump based diabetes care (CSII),
   and INCA based diabetes care. Both models were parameterised with costs
   and simulated to determine yearly costs of diabetes management and
   treatment for a patient with no diabetes related complications.
   Probability of developing complications and their duration were
   determined based on the Archimedes model. It was parameterised with
   results of a clinical study concerning HbA1c-value changes using the
   INCA system compared with conventional CSII. The simulation results in
   form of years of disease within a 30-year time frame were multiplied
   with corresponding treatment costs.
   Results: Yearly costs of conventional insulin CSII for a diabetes type 1
   patient are D 5908 (German health care system). Using INCA based on the
   clinical study setting would raise yearly costs by (sic)2233. 24\% of
   the INCA costs are generated by the continuous blood glucose measurement
   device, 5\% by IT devices and services. Considering also diabetes
   related complications in a 30-year time frame and HbA1c value reductions
   from 7.9 and 7.6\% (conventional CSII) to 7.5 and 7.3\% (INCA) reduces
   the additional costs of INCA to D 2102 and (sic)2162.
   Conclusions: The approach produces an estimation of a lower bound for
   cost savings concerning the treatment of diabetes related complications
   in a 30-year time frame. These savings alone do not prove cost
   efficiency of the INCA approach. Further work is needed to improve the
   approximation and to include indirect and intangible costs. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Infiltration of inflammatory cells into pancreatic islets of Langerhans
   and selective destruction of insulin-secreting beta-cells are
   characteristics of type 1 diabetes. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a
   mitochondrial protein expressed in immune cells. UCP2 controls
   macrophage activation by modulating the production of mitochondrial
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MAPK signaling. We investigated the
   role of UCP2 on immune cell activity in type 1 diabetes in
   Ucp2-deficient mice. Using the model of multiple low-dose streptozotocin
   (STZ)-induced diabetes, we found that autoimmune diabetes was strongly
   accelerated in Ucp2-KO mice, compared with Ucp2-WT mice with increased
   intraislet lymphocytic infiltration. Macrophages from STZ-treated
   Ucp2-KO mice had increased IL-1 beta and nitric oxide (NO) production,
   compared with WT macrophages. Moreover, more macrophages were recruited
   in islets of STZ-treated Ucp2-KO mice, compared with Ucp2-WT mice. This
   finding also was accompanied by increased NO/ROS-induced damage.
   Altogether, our data show that inflammation is stronger in Ucp2-KO mice
   and islets, leading to the exacerbated disease in these mice. Our
   results highlight the mitochondrial protein UCP2 as a new player in

Abstract = {{FoxP3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in the
   maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance, and it has been suggested that
   diabetes-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice are defective in the
   generation and numbers of Tregs. We found thymic selection of Tregs to
   be under genetic control. Fetal thymic organ cultures on the NOD
   background required 3- to 10-fold more antigen than corresponding
   cultures on the B6 background for optimal induction of Tregs, but once
   the threshold for induction was reached the NOD background yielded close
   to 10-fold more Tregs. This increased selection of Tregs was also found
   in non-transgenic NOD mice in fetal through adult stages. This trait did
   not map to the MHC, idd3, or the chromosome 3 (Chr3) regions that
   control clonal deletion, but mainly to two regions on Chr1 and Chr11.
   Thus, NOD mice do not have a global defect in the generation or
   maintenance of Tregs; if anything, they show the opposite.}},

Abstract = {{Over time, most patients with Type 2 diabetes require
   insulin-replacement therapy to attain and sustain the increasingly
   stringent glycemic goals. Initiation of subcutaneous insulin may be
   delayed due to patient or provider resistance. This delay may increase
   the risk of complications from long-term hyperglycemia. The development
   of inhaled insulin-delivery systems has been pursued to facilitate
   earlier initiation and optimization of insulin therapy to achieve better
   treatment outcomes. The AIR(R) Inhaled Insulin System utilizes
   relatively large, low-density particles, allowing efficient drug
   delivery to the deep lung from a simple inhaler. In clinical studies it
   has provided similar postprandial glycemic control compared with
   subcutaneously injected, short-acting insulin, and was preferred by more
   patients. The purpose of this article is to describe the AIR Inhaled
   Insulin System, provide an overview of other insulin-delivery systems
   and discuss future strategies for the treatment of diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate a Web-based, p atient- orientated
   diabetic education management (POEM) system.
   Methods: The POEM system has been developed to extend hospital patient
   education by integrating patients' medical care data into their
   education program components and presenting them on the Web. Since most
   patients are concerned about their medical care data, the POEM system
   can provide the incentives for patients to continuously and persistently
   log in and learn the required knowledge and skills, improving their
   clinical outcomes. A quasi- experimental method that uses control groups
   and pretests was used to evaluate the outcomes of the system
   intervention. We recruited patients with type-2 diabetes and
   alternatively assigned them to intervention and control groups. We
   compared laboratory test results including fasting blood glucose, HbAlc,
   total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and HDI. between the two groups
   from the first visit through each follow-up visit. The study period
   progressed from September 2003 to May 2004 at the Metabolism Center of a
   medical teaching hospital in Taipei.
   Results: In this study, we recruited 274 participants: 134 (S7\% males
   and 43\% females) in the intervention group and 140 (46\% males and 54\%
   females) in the control group. The patients' laboratory test results
   from the first visit for fasting blood glucose, HbAlc, total cholesterol
   level, TG, and HDL in the intervention and control groups were
   respec.tively 187.54 +/- 77.10 and 189.99 +/- 73.49 mg/dl, 9.03 +/-
   2.79\% and 8.9 +/- 2.23\%, 193.29 +/- 47.93 and 202.52 +/- 58.45mg/dl,
   152.48 +/- 70.85 and 157.37 +/- 74.88mg/dI, and 44.97 +/- 12.09 and
   45.32 +/- 12.08 mg/dI. There were three follow-up visits during the
   study period. We collected laboratory test results of the two groups
   through each of the following visits and analyzed them using ANCOVA. We
   discovered a significant difference in fasting blood glucose levels
   between intervention and control group as early as the first follow-up.
   At the second follow-up, both fasting blood glucose and HBAlc levels
   were significantly different between intervention and control group. At
   the third follow-up, there was a significant difference in fasting blood
   glucose, HBA1c, and total cholesterol between intervention and control
   group. We also monitored the number of logins for the patients in the
   intervention group during the follow-up period. The result showed the
   patients had consistently logged into the POEM system (about 8.5 +/- 3.7
   logins per person per month after 3 months enrollment). Thus, the
   patients in the intervention group had better control of their fasting
   blood glucose, HbAlc and total cholesterol levels than those in the
   control group due to the assistance of the system.
   Conclusions: The POEM system can help patients control their glucose,
   HbAlc and total cholesterol levels to manage their diabetes, providing
   an easy and inexpensive way to extend hospital-based patient education
   services for community-based continuous patient education.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children results from autoimmune destruction of
   pancreatic beta cells, leading to insufficient production of insulin(1).
   A number of genetic determinants of T1D have already been established
   through candidate gene studies, primarily within the major
   histocompatibility complex(2-4) but also within other loci(5-12). To
   identify new genetic factors that increase the risk of T1D, we performed
   a genome-wide association study in a large paediatric cohort of European
   descent. In addition to confirming previously identified loci(2-9), we
   found that T1D was significantly associated with variation within a
   233-kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 16p13. This region
   contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a
   sugar-binding, C-type lectin. Three common non-coding variants of the
   gene (rs2903692, rs725613 and rs17673553) in strong linkage
   disequilibrium reached genome-wide significance for association with
   T1D. A subsequent transmission disequilibrium test replication study in
   an independent cohort confirmed the association. These results indicate
   that KIAA0350 might be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D and
   demonstrate the utility of the genome-wide association approach in the
   identification of previously unsuspected genetic determinants of complex

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that the classic minimal model (MM) and the

   different from MM S-I = 10.71 (units 1/min per mu U/ml, alpha = 0.001)
   with a strong correlation (R-S = 0.83, alpha = 0.01). LMM S-G(L) =
   0.0407 appears to be significantly different to S-G = 0.0266 (units

   required to address the effect of modeling and signal processing on
   them. For the data under study, the models are not able to fit
   two-thirds of the data windows available. This is because none of the
   models are able to follow complex situations such as the presence of
   several bolus injections, the absence of insulin supply or inappropriate
   insulin dosage. A synthesis of the patterns found in these windows is
   presented which would be useful for the development of new models for

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental
   factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were
   hitherto unknown. A systematic search for these variants was recently
   made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the
   genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case - control cohort.
   Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies
   between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for
   testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing
   variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the
   known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a
   non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is
   expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta-cells, and two linkage
   disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in
   beta-cell development or function (IDE - KIF11 - HHEX and EXT2 - ALX4).

   system is to estimate the appropriate insulin infusion rates. The system
   is based on a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) which uses a
   hybrid model. The model comprises a Compartmental Model (04), which
   simulates the absorption of the glucose to the blood due to meal
   intakes, and a Neural Network (NN), which simulates the glucose-insulin
   kinetics. The NN is a Recurrent NN (RNN) trained with the Real Time
   Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The output of the model consists of
   short term glucose predictions and provides input to the NMPC, in order
   for the latter to estimate the optimum insulin infusion rates. For the
   development and the evaluation of the HAS, data generated from a
   Mathematical Model (MM) of a Type 1 diabetes patient have been used. The
   proposed control strategy is evaluated at multiple meal disturbances,
   various noise levels and additional time delays. The results indicate
   that the implemented IIAS is capable of handling multiple meals, which
   correspond to realistic meal profiles, large noise levels and time

   lessen this negative impact. We wished to learn from adolescents with
   diabetes and their parents how monitoring systems that incorporated
   mobile communication technology could potentially help to reduce hassles
   associated with testing, improve compliance, and ease adolescent-parent
   conflict about testing behavior. We recruited adolescents between the
   ages of 13 and 18 years, living with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their
   parents for focus groups. Qualitative analysis of the focus group data
   followed a set procedure. From the discussions, the following themes
   were identified: issues with blood glucose monitoring and desired
   technology. Elements of desired technology included hardware
   requirements, software requirements, communication, and miscellaneous
   requirements. The reported needs of this end user group can help others
   to leverage maximally the capabilities of new and existing technology to
   care for children managing chronic disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Foot ulceration occurs frequently on the plantar aspect of
   the metatarsal head region, in which the altered foot biomechanics has
   been mentioned as a contributor. This study attempted to compare the
   energy dissipation in the plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head
   between type 2 diabetic patients and age-matched healthy subjects in
   vivo.
   Methods. The plantar soft tissues under the metatarsal heads in each
   left foot of 13 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and eight
   age-matched healthy subjects were measured with a loading-unloading
   device. The system comprised a 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound
   transducer and a load cell that operated at an impact velocity of about
   5 cm/s. The stress-strain plot was derived by simultaneously recording
   the stress response and tissue deformation during a loading-unloading
   cycle. The energy dissipation ratio in all subjects could then be
   analyzed.
   Findings. Although only the plantar soft tissue under the fourth
   metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endured significantly greater
   energy (P = 0.035) than the healthy subjects, a trend of an increased
   energy dissipation ratio for the metatarsals in the diabetic patients
   was observed.
   Interpretation. The plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head in the
   diabetic patients endures high dissipated energy during a simulating
   walking status in the study. The increased dissipated energy in the
   tissue may be responsible for the tissue breakdown in the diabetic
   patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical studies suggest a role for dietary glycemic index (GI) in body
   weight regulation and diabetes risk. However, partly because
   manipulation of GI can produce changes in different biochemical
   parameters and on appetite regulation, its relevance to human health
   remains controversial. Studies on the effect of low vs. high glycemic
   index foods on the different metabolism parameters in rats are still not
   enough.
   Therefore, in the present study we examined the role of glycemic index
   and its effect on cholesterol levels in blood and the change in
   epididymal fat mass in obese rats. We demonstrate that rats on a high
   glycemic index (HGI) diet have higher plasma cholesterol levels compared
   with the control group. Moreover, the group on HGI food shows a
   significant increase in the epididymal fat pad.}},

   supported by a more structured method. That method should include
   support for proper selection between types of archetypes, such as

   strain is potentially diabetogenic under the correct conditions. Rapid
   T1D onset is preceded by CVB replication in islet cells including beta
   cells. Although CVB strains do not productively infect healthy islets of

Abstract = {{Mouse models represent a powerful tool for investigating the underlying
   mechanisms of disease. Type 1 diabetes results in a markedly increased
   risk of cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular complications are
   manifested primarily as ischemic heart disease caused by accelerated
   atherosclerosis, but also as cardiomyopathy, defined as ventricular
   dysfunction in the absence of clear ischemic heart disease. Several
   mouse models are now available to study atherosclerosis and
   cardiomyopathy associated with type 1 diabetes. For studies of
   diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, these models include low-density
   lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice
   in which diabetes is induced by streptozotocin or viral infection. In
   these mouse models, type I diabetes can be induced without marked
   changes in plasma lipid levels, thereby mimicking the accelerated
   atherosclerosis seen in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, mouse
   models that exhibit thrombotic events and myocardial infarctions as a
   result of diabetes still need to be developed. Conversely,
   cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes has now been extensively
   evaluated in streptozotocin-treated C57BL/6 mice, and in transgenic mice
   expressing calmodulin under a beta-cell-specific promoter. These mouse
   models have given significant insight into the molecular mechanisms
   causing cardiomyopathy, and indicate that increased oxidative stress
   contributes to diabetes-associated cardiomyopathy. In this review, we
   will discuss the available mouse models for studies of cardiovascular
   complications of type 1 diabetes, the potential mechanisms underlying
   these complications, and the need for new and improved mouse models.}},

Journal = {{METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2007}},

Pages = {{553-557}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. How accurate can trained clinicians predict blood glucose
   concentrations? Good clinical treatment is, among other things, related
   to understanding the factors influencing blood glucose level. We analyze
   trained clinician's prediction accuracy in comparison with selected
   computer-implemented prediction algorithms and models.
   Methods: We have in this study included diaries of 12 people with type 1
   diabetes. This test group consists of seven males and five females, ages
   24 to 60, HbA(1c) 6.0 to 8.9 and a BMI between 20 and 28 kg/m(2). Eight
   experienced clinicians tried to predict the blood glucose measurements
   based on minimum three days of diary history. Selected prediction
   algorithms and models were used for comparison. The reason we focus on
   type I diabetes is that it has the most critical insulin requirement, so
   accurate prediction can be more critical than for type 2.
   Results: An accuracy of 28.5\% and an error of 26.7\% were found from
   predictions made by the clinicians. A physiological model and an
   artificial intelligence model showed higher accuracy of 32.2\% and
   34.2\% in comparison with the clinicians (p < 0.05). A simple predictor
   algorithm based on the mean blood glucose history showed significant (p
   < 0.05) lower total root mean square error compared to predictions made
   by the clinicians.
   Conclusion: To predict blood glucose level from diaries has shown to be
   profoundly difficult even for experienced clinicians in comparison with
   predictions from computer algorithms and models. This suggests that
   computer-based systems incorporating predicting algorithms and models
   are likely to contribute positively to the day-to-day treatment of
   people with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an unfavorable
   prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI), partially due to a higher
   risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). QT dynamicity is an independent
   predictor of SCD in post-MI patients. However, the effects of diabetes
   on QT dynamicity in patients with MI have not been described.
   Methods: We studied 468 survivors of MI (67 with DM) from the
   population-based MONICA registry (KORA Family Heart Study), Augsburg,
   Germany, by standardized questionnaire, anthropometry, electrocardiogram
   (ECG), 30-minute-Holter-ECG-recordings and echocardiography. In
   addition, 422 siblings without prior MI (22 with DM) were studied by the
   same protocol.
   Results: Among post-MI patients, the QT/RR slope was significantly
   steeper in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.096 +/- 0.057 vs 0.077 +/-
   0.045; P = 0.002). Likewise, among siblings without MI, the QT/RR slope
   was steeper in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.104 +/- 0.053 vs 0.080
   +/- 0.042; P = 0.008). The association of DM with steeper QT/RR slope
   remained significant in multivariate models in post-MI patients (beta:
   -0.14; P = 0.004) as well as in individuals without MI (beta -0.10; P =
   0.047).
   Conclusions: In a large population of survivors of MI and unaffected
   siblings, patients and siblings presenting with DM exhibited an abnormal
   QT rate-dependence, compared with individuals without DM in both groups.
   Thus, diabetes itself maybe a major determinant of ventricular
   arrhythmias, independently of a previous MI. These observations might in
   part explain the higher incidence of sudden cardiac death and
   ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DM.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the medical cost of managing individuals with diabetes
   has been increased, and it has become one of the socio-national issues.
   Diabetes self-management includes blood glucose monitoring, physical
   activity management, nutritional management, and medications for his
   whole lifetime. And also it needs continuous communication between
   patient and his doctor for usual life style as well clinical treatment;
   it's the key to successful self-management of diabetes. We have
   developed a ubiquitous healthcare system for diabetes self-management,
   so called ``MDoctor for DM{''} in anytime and anywhere manner. This
   system is effective for managing blood glucose, nutrition, physical
   activity, and medication using a cellular phone. Blood glucose and
   physical activity can be monitored by a small device attachable to a
   cellular phone. The measured data is stored in the cellular phone and
   transferred to a remote health-log server via wireless internet, finally
   reviewed by the primary physician of the patient. ``MDoctor for DM{''}
   consists of three subsystem; MDoctor mobile system, MyHealth system, and
   U-Clinic system. MDoctor mobile system is a mobile device for monitoring
   bio-signals including blood glucose and physical activity; MyHealth
   system is a web-based system to store and transfer the monitored data
   via internet; U-Clinic System enables the primary physician to review
   the patient's health condition and to support the physician to guide his
   patient with knowledge-based clinical support system. Physician using
   the U-Clinic System can provide the self-management supporting service
   to the patients apart, and the integrated diabetic care based on both
   in-house clinical data and self-monitored data from the outpatients.
   ``MDoctor for DM{''} is designed to do self-management of blood glucose,
   physical activity, nutrition, and medication using a cell phone, and
   this study evaluates this system is efficient to both patients and
   physicians.}},

Abstract = {{The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is an important indicator when
   measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and assessing the
   burden of disease, especially for chronic conditions such as diabetes
   mellitus (DM). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the scores
   of HRQOL for respondents with DM to examine associations between overall
   HUI3 scores and eight component attributes, and various sociodemographic
   and lifestyle attributes, and by doing so, provide information to
   improve the HRQOL of individuals with diabetes. The study was based on
   the Canadian National Population Survey (NPHS) longitudinal data, from
   1994-1995 to 2002-2003. We evaluated overall HUI3 scores and eight
   attributes (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion,
   cognition, and pain) between respondents with and without diabetes in
   relation to demographic characteristics (age, sex, lifestyle, and
   socioeconomic status using ANCOVA{[}analysis of covariance]). Awareness
   of diabetes appeared to affect the HRQOL of older age groups more so
   than younger age groups (p < 0.01). Diabetes also appeared to have a
   greater impact on males' quality of life compared to females', and among
   individuals with single marital status and low socioeconomic status (p <
   0.01). These findings add to what is known about cognitive
   representations and the self-regulation of diabetes as well as the
   relationships between cognitive representations of diabetes, HRQOL, and
   behavioral factors. In particular, results from this study suggest the
   need to address ways of reducing the burden of diabetes associated with
   health behaviours, and increasing the quality of life for the
   individuals with diabetes in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Stress-induced hyperglycaemia is prevalent in intensive care, impairing
   the immune response. Nutritional support regimes with high glucose
   content further exacerbate the problem. Tight glucose control has been
   shown to reduce mortality by up to 43\% if levels are kept below 6.1
   mmol/L. This research develops a control algorithm with insulin and
   nutritional inputs for targeted glucose control in the critically ill.
   Ethics approval for this research was granted by the Canterbury Ethics
   Committee. Proof-of-concept clinical pilot trials were conducted on
   intubated, insulin-dependent Christchurch ICU patients (n=7) on constant
   nutritional support. A target 10-15\% reduction in glucose level per
   hour for a desired glucose level of 4-6 mmol/L was set. 43\% and 91 \%
   of glucose targets were achieved within +/- 5 and +/- 20\%,
   respectively. The mean error was 8.9\% (0.5 mmol/L), with an absolute
   range {[}0, 2.9] mmol/L. End glucose levels were 40\% lower compared to
   initial values. All large target errors are attributable to sudden
   changes in patient physiology at low glucose values, rather than
   systemic deficiencies. Target errors are consistent with and explainable
   by published sensor error distributions. The results show that intensive
   model-based glucose management with nutrition control reduced absolute
   glucose levels progressively while reducing the severity of glycaemic
   fluctuation even with significant inter-patient variability and
   time-varying physiological condition. Trials spanning longer periods of
   time are in development to verify the short-term pilot studies performed
   and to test the adaptability of the controller. Clinically, these
   results indicate potential in clinical use to reduce ICU mortality as
   well as reduce risk of severe complications. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by

Abstract = {{An advanced model-based control technique for regulating the blood

   insulin delivery rate is obtained off-line as an explicit function of

   The implementation of the optimal insulin delivery rate, therefore,
   requires simple function evaluation and minimal on-line computations.
   The proposed framework also addresses the uncertainty in the model due
   to interpatient and intrapatient variability by identifying the model
   parameters which ensure that a feasible control law can be obtained. The
   developments reported in this paper are expected to simplify the insulin
   delivery mechanism, thereby enhancing the quality of life of the

Abstract = {{A wave of apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs normally in
   pancreatic beta-cclls of newborn mice. We previously showed that
   macrophages from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice become activated more
   slowly and engulf apoptotic cells at a lower rate than macrophages from
   control (Balb/c) mice. It has been hypothesized that this low clearance
   could result in secondary necrosis, escalating inflammation and
   self-antigen presentation that later triggers autoimmune, Type 1
   diabetes (TID). We here investigate whether this hypothesis could offer
   a reasonable and parsimonious explanation for onset of T1D in NOD mice.
   We quantify variants of the Copenhagen model (Freiesleben De Blasio et
   al. 1999 Diabetes 48, 1677), based on parameters from NOD and Balb/c
   experimental data. We show that the original Copenhagen model fails to
   explain observed phenomena within a reasonable range of parameter
   values, predicting an unrealistic-or-none disease occurrence for both
   strains. However, if we take into account that, in general, activated
   macrophages produce harmful cytokines only when engulfing necrotic (but
   not apoptotic) cells, then the revised model becomes qualitatively and
   quantitatively reasonable. Further, we show that known differences
   between NOD and Balb/c mouse macrophage kinetics are large enough to
   account for the fact that an apoptotic wave can trigger escalating
   inflammatory response in NOD, but not Balb/c mice. In Balb/c mice,
   macrophages clear the apoptotic wave so efficiently, that chronic
   inflammation is prevented.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed nutritionally induced, insulin-resistant Indian perch,

   hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, loss of insulin sensitivity and
   increase in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)). Skeletal muscle cells
   from FFA-treated perch showed defects in insulin signalling molecules
   suggesting its link to the impairment of insulin action, a situation
   similar to that found in insulin-resistant mammalian species and human

   with type 1 diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with
   a meal challenge and corresponding subcutaneous insulin bolus. The data
   collected were used to fit the model parameters using global

   experimental conditions, and as such can be used to simulate subject
   behavior under the experimental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperglycaemia is prevalent in critical care and tight control can
   reduce mortality from 9-43\% depending on the level of control and the
   cohort. This research presents a table-based method that varies both
   insulin dose and nutritional input to achieve tight control. The system
   mimics a previously validated model-based system, but can be used for
   long term, large patient number clinical evaluation. This paper
   evaluates this method in simulation using retrospective data and then
   compares clinical measurements over 15,000 patient hours to validate the
   models and development approach. This validation thus also validates the
   in silica comparison to the landmark clinical tight glycaemic control
   protocols. Overall, an average clinical glucose level is 5.9 +/- 1.0
   mmol/L, matching simulation, however the overall clinical glucose
   distribution is slightly tighter than that obtained in simulation,
   indicating that the retrospective virtual trial design approach is
   slightly conservative. Finally, the model based approach is shown to
   have tighter control than existing, more ad-hoc clinical approaches
   based on the simulation results that qualitatively match reported
   clinical results, but also show significant variation around the average
   levels obtained in both the hypo-and hyper- glycaemic ranges.}},

   CMs, along with previous glucose measurements, are fed to a NN, which

Abstract = {{Although the defects in the sarcolemma (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum
   (SR) membranes are known to be associated with cardiac dysfunction in
   chronic diabetes, very little information regarding the mechanisms of
   these membrane abnormalities is available in the literature. For this
   reason, rats were treated daily for 8 weeks with and without enalapril,
   an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or losartan, an angiotensin
   receptor antagonist, 3 days after inducing diabetes with an injection of
   streptozocin. Treatment of diabetic animals with both enalapril and
   losartan attenuated alterations in cardiac function and the left
   ventricular redox potential without any changes in the increased plasma
   glucose or reduced plasma insulin levels. The SL Na+-K+ ATPase, Ca2+
   pump, Na+-dependent Ca2+-uptake, Ca2+-channel density, and low-affinity
   Ca2+-binding activities were depressed whereas Ca2+ ecto-ATPase activity
   was increased in the diabetic heart. Furthermore, the SR Ca2+-release
   and Ca2+-pump activities in the diabetic hearts were decreased without
   any changes in the Mg2+-ATPase activity. These alterations in SL and SR
   membranes in diabetic animals were partly prevented by treatments with
   enalapril and losartan. The results suggest that the activation of the
   renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in diabetes-induced
   changes in SL and SR membranes as well as cardiac function.}},

   single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) given intraperitoneally (60 mg/kg

   diabetic (n = 6) and normal (n = 6), Zucker lean (n = 6), and GK (n = 6)
   rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and their DRGs were removed
   and processed for immunohistochemistry. CGRP-positive neurons were
   observed in the DRG of normal and diabetic Wistar, Zucker lean
   (nondiabetic), and GK (animal model of type 2 diabetes) rats. CGRP was
   present in small-, medium-, and large-sized neurons of the DRG in these
   three animal models. Only a small percentage of large-sized neurons
   contains CGRP. The number of CGRP-positive neurons was significantly (P
   < 0.05) reduced in STZ-induced diabetic Wistar and GK rats compared to
   normal Wistar and Zucker lean rats. Moreover, the quantity of
   CGRP-containing varicose nerves was less in diabetic Wistar and GK rats
   compared to control Wistar and Zucker lean rats. The reduced number of

Abstract = {{Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of beta
   cells by autoantigen-specific T cells. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD)
   mouse model, CD8(+) T cells play an essential role in both the initial
   triggering of insulitis and its destructive phase, and proinsulin (PI)
   is one of the dominant target antigens (Ags). However, little is known
   about the beta cell epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules and
   recognized by human CD8+ T cells. We and other groups recently applied
   reverse immunology approaches to identify HLA class I-restricted PI
   epitopes. To establish an inventory of potential naturally processed
   epitopes, whole human PI or the transitional region between the B-chain
   and C-peptide were digested with purified proteasome complexes. By
   combining proteasome digestion data with epitope prediction algorithms,
   candidate epitopes restricted by HLA-A2.1 and other HLA class I
   molecules were identified. We validated immunogenicity and natural
   processing of the identified PI epitopes in HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice,
   while others demonstrated recognition of multiple PI epitopes by CD8+ T
   cells from T1DM and healthy subjects in the context of different HLA
   class I molecules. These results demonstrate the power of reverse
   immunology strategies for epitope discovery. DNA vaccination of
   HLA-transgenic mice may be another rapid and efficient reverse
   immunology approach to map additional epitopes derived from other T1DM
   Ags, such as IA-2 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65). Transfer
   of this information to Elispot- and MHC tetramer-based assay formats
   should allow to reliably detect and characterize autoreactive CD8+ T
   cell responses in T1DM, and may open new avenues for early T1DM
   diagnosis and immune intervention.}},

   lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 family, spontaneously develop lupus-like
   autoimmune disease and autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy on C57BL/6 and
   BALB/c backgrounds, respectively. However, how PD-1 deficiency induces
   different forms of autoimmune diseases on these two strains was unknown.
   Here, we report that PD-1 deficiency specifically accelerates the onset
   and frequency of type I diabetes in NOD (nonobese diabetic) mice, with
   strong T helper 1 polarization of T cells infiltrating into islets.
   These results suggest that PD-1 deficiency accelerates autoimmune
   predisposition of the background strain, leading to the induction of
   different forms of autoimmune diseases depending on the genetic
   background of the strain. Using NOD-Pdcd1(-/-) mice as an efficient
   animal model of type I diabetes, we screened diabetes-susceptible loci
   by genetic linkage analysis. The diabetic incidence of NOD-Pdcd1(-/-)

Abstract = {{The classical minimal model with single compartment was modified by the

Abstract = {{The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase isoform (JNK) 1 is implicated in type 2
   diabetes. However, a potential role for the JNK2 protein kinase in
   diabetes has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that JNK2 may
   play an important role in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes that is
   caused by autoimmune destruction of \&beta; cells. Studies of nonobese
   diabetic mice demonstrated that disruption of the Mapk9 gene (which
   encodes the JNK2 protein kinase) decreased destructive insulitis and
   reduced disease progression to diabetes. CD4(+) T cells from
   JNK2-deficient nonobese diabetic mice produced less IFN-\&gamma; but
   significantly increased amounts of IL-4 and IL-5, indicating
   polarization toward the Th2 phenotype. This role of JNK2 to control the
   Th1/Th2 balance of the immune response represents a mechanism of
   protection against autoimmune diabetes. We conclude that JNK protein
   kinases may have important roles in diabetes, including functions of
   JNK1 in type 2 diabetes and JNK2 in type 1 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simulation model of glucose-insulin metabolism for Type
   1 diabetes patients is presented. The proposed system is based on the
   combination of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks
   (NNs). This model alms at the development of an accurate system, in
   order to assist Type 1 diabetes patients to handle their blood glucose
   profile and recognize dangerous metabolic states. Data from a Type 1
   diabetes patient, stored in a database, have been used as input to the
   hybrid system. The data contain information about measured blood glucose
   levels, insulin intake, and description of food intake, along with the
   corresponding time. The data are passed to three separate CMs, which
   produce estimations about (i) the effect of Short Acting (SA) insulin
   intake on blood insulin concentration, (ii) the effect of Intermediate
   Acting (IA) insulin intake on blood insulin concentration, and (iii) the
   effect of carbohydrate intake on blood glucose absorption from the gut.
   The outputs of the three CMs are passed to a Recurrent NN (RNN) in order
   to predict subsequent blood glucose levels. The RNN is trained with the
   Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The resulted blood
   glucose predictions are promising for the use of the proposed model for
   blood glucose level estimation for Type 1 diabetes patients.}},

Abstract = {{In the paper an open access internet based computer system has been
   described, visualizing the patient's postprandial plasma glucose (PPG),
   determined from an adaptive simulation model of pancreas gland. In the
   insulin-dependent diabetes, which requires continual insulin dosing, it
   is necessary to coordinate the meal time with the drug injection. In the
   insulin-independent diabetes, if it has been diagnosed early enough, a
   properly composed diet may be a sufficient form of therapy. In both
   cases the visualization of the plasma glucose level, correlated with the
   nutrition equivalent of the recent meals, may be helpful in limiting the
   invasive procedures or assist in proper choice of the diet. At the same
   time the results of such a simulation may be used by persons fighting
   obesity, as a direct help in distinguishing between physiological hunger
   and the abnormal one, resulting from excessive variations of glucose and
   insulin levels in blood. One of the intermediate goals of the present
   paper was the introduction of proper modifications to the existing model
   of the dynamic glucose-insulin dependence, in order to enable the
   prediction of PPG levels for both healthy and ill persons, based on the
   last meal time and its nutrition rate determined by the Glycemic Index
   (GI). Additionally the model has been enhanced to take into account
   individual parameters (adaptiveness), which may affect the simulation
   results. A simplified version of the application may be implemented in
   portable devices like palmtops or mobile phones.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate the efficacy of diabetes-targeted cell
   therapies in humans, a reliable model in larger animals is highly
   desirable. This article reports the surgical technique of total
   pancreatectomy in pigs and the biochemical analysis of the
   characteristics of totally pancreatectomized pigs. Methods: Surgical
   total pancreatectomy was conducted in 23 pigs. Blood glucose, insulin,
   biochemistries, activity index, and intravenous glucose tolerance test
   (IVGTT) were examined to assess the pathophysiological profiles of
   diabetic pigs. Results: A total of 14 pigs successfully underwent total
   pancreatectomy without requiring biliary reconstruction and were
   analyzed in the present study. Activity index was decreased from day 5
   on and the mean survival of totally pancreatectomized pigs was 7.6 +/-
   2.7 days. No endogenous insulin secretion was confirmed in these pigs.
   Pigs which received total pancreatectomy demonstrated significantly
   higher levels of ketone bodies. IVGTT performed within 4 days after
   total pancreatectomy showed a spontaneous decrease in blood glucose
   levels despite an absence of endogenous insulin secretion. IVGTT on day
   5 or later showed continued hyperglycemia in pigs with total
   pancreatectomy. Histological examination showed atrophy of hepatocytes
   and decreased glycogen storage in the liver and decreased mucus
   production of the small intestine. Conclusion: This article describes a
   porcine model of diabetes created by total pancreatectomy and it
   analyzes the pathophysiological profiles in the animals. The present
   study has suggested that IVGTT on day 5 or later after total
   pancreatectomy is a reliable method to evaluate the efficacy of cell

Abstract = {{Purpose: The web, a widely accessed medium for patients to obtain health
   information, has special relevance for patients with diabetes. This
   paper critiques the publicly available web sites for diabetes, and it
   establishes criteria for excellence in these sites. Methods: A web
   search for diabetes mellitus based on Google, Yahoo, and the directory
   Mendosa provided the basis for the study. We defined and evaluated three
   major categories for each site: usability, content, and reliability.
   Usability was defined by design, ease of navigation, interactivity, and
   internal search capability. Content was based on the quality of general
   information about diabetes, discussions about monitoring blood glucose,
   meat planning, exercise, complications, medications, alternative
   therapies, resources, and support systems. Reliability was defined by
   the presence of the HON code, identification of an author, and the
   availability of experts. Results: The focused Mendosa search produced 47
   web sites. The majority were published by commercial organizations. Five
   sites were found to have the best usability. Other sites were cluttered
   or inundated with distracting information from advertisements. Content
   was generally excellent but limited by an absence of specific advice and
   information about controlling associated risk factors for cardiovascular
   disease. Only 17\% of sites met all criteria for reliability. The sites
   that best met the criteria for quality were the American Diabetes
   Association (www.diabetes.org) and the Joslin Diabetes Center
   (www.joslin.org). Conclusions: Despite the large numbers of publicly

Abstract = {{A nonlinear model predictive controller has been developed to maintain
   normoglycemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes during fasting conditions
   such as during overnight fast. The controller employs a compartment
   model, which represents the glucoregulatory system and includes
   submodels representing absorption of subcutaneously administered
   short-acting insulin Lispro and gut absorption. The controller uses
   Bayesian parameter estimation to determine time-varying model
   parameters. Moving target trajectory facilitates slow, controlled
   normalization of elevated glucose levels and faster normalization of low
   glucose values. The predictive capabilities of the model have been
   evaluated using data from 15 clinical experiments in subjects with type
   1 diabetes. The experiments employed intravenous glucose sampling (every
   15 min) and subcutaneous infusion of insulin Lispro by insulin pump
   (modified also every 15 min). The model gave glucose predictions with a
   mean square error proportionally related to the prediction horizon with
   the value of 0.2 mmol L-1 per 15 min. The assessment of clinical utility
   of model-based glucose predictions using Clarke error grid analysis gave
   95\% of values in zone A and the remaining 5\% of values in zone B for
   glucose predictions up to 60 min (n = 1674). In conclusion, adaptive
   nonlinear model predictive control is promising for the control of

Abstract = {{(Prepro)insulin is considered a central antigenic determinant in
   diabetic autoimmunity. Insulin has been used to modify diabetes
   development in NOD mice and prediabetic individuals. We have recently
   shown that (prepro)insulin can adversely promote diabetes development in
   murine type 1 diabetes. Based on these findings we have developed
   experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD), a new mouse model characterized
   by (1) CD4(+)/CD8(+) insulitis, induced by (2) (prepro)insulin DNA
   vaccination, leading to (3) beta cell damage and insulin deficiency in
   (4) RIP-B7.1 transgenic mice (H-2b). EAD develops rapidly in 60-95\% of
   mice after intramuscular, but not intradermal ({''}gene gun{''}),
   vaccination; and DNA plasmids expressing insulin or the insulin
   analogues glargine, aspart, and lispro are equally potent to induce EAD.
   Similar to NOD mice, diabetes is adoptively transferred into syngeneic
   recipients by spleen cell transplantation in a dose-dependent fashion.
   We have devised a two-stage concept of EAD in which T cell activation
   and expansion is driven by in vivo autoantigen expression, followed by
   islet damage that requires beta cell expression of costimulatory B7.1
   for disease manifestation. Taken together, EAD is a novel, genetically
   defined animal model of type 1 diabetes suitable to analyze mechanisms
   and consequences of insulin-specific T cell autoimmunity.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is
   shifting towards a younger age and the incidence rate is rising.
   Epidemiology studies suggest that a child's risk for disease may
   correlate with their developmental stage, as the highest incidence rate
   was observed in the first few years of life, and around puberty. The
   underlying mechanisms for these observations are still not known.
   Utilizing a mathematical model of T1DM pathogenesis that we recently
   developed, we approach this question through the study of the dynamic
   process of beta-cell destruction. We found that the system dynamic
   stability of an individual depends on the natural turnover of beta-cell.
   More active beta-cell mass dynamics will lead to a less stable system
   against pathological disturbance, and vice versa. Together with the
   facts that the beta-cell turnover is very rapid during the neonatal age
   and is elevated again during puberty, and the developmental secular
   trend in recent decades, our model potentially offers an explanation for
   the epidemiological observations. We will also discuss the implications
   of these findings to the genetic and epidemiological study of diabetes,
   as well as to its prevention and management.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We have recently shown, in studies with patients with Type
   1 (insulin dependent) diabetes, that alcohol intake at 21:00 h
   significantly reduced blood glucose values after 10-12 h, compared with
   control studies with no alcohol. Hypothesis: We hypothesised that this
   was due to the following effects of alcohol: (1) alcohol metabolism
   increases NADH, leading to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis; (2)
   increased glycogen phosphorylase activity depletes hepatic glycogen
   stores; (3) after the alcohol is metabolised, hepatic insulin
   sensitivity is increased, leading to the restoration of glycogen stores
   and reduction in blood glucose Levels; and (4) consequently, after
   several hours, glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity return to normal.
   Results: A model describing these changes (DiasNet-Alcohol) was
   implemented into the DiasNet model of human glucose metabolism. Our
   study suggests that the DiasNet-Alcohol model gives a reasonable
   approximation of these effects of alcohol on blood glucose concentration
   observed in our study and supports our hypothesis for the mechanism
   behind these effects in Type 1 diabetes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

   This method can act as a tool for medical professionals and provides the
   crucial explanatory component, including citations to the relevant

Abstract = {{Many diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are concerned about unstable blood
   glucose, even with regular monitoring by a family doctor. The insulin
   preparation shows peak action at several hours after subcutaneous
   administration. For this reason, unstable blood glucose is often caused
   by intensive insulin therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG).
   The insulin requirement is determined in proportion to fasting blood
   glucose (FBG) in the sliding scale method. A fixed amount of insulin is
   administered regardless of FBG level in the constant insulin method.
   It is indispensable to estimate FBG at peak time, A hen insulin works
   the hardest, to obtain the appropriate effect of insulin administration.
   We employed the local fuzzy reconstruction method based on chaos theory
   for predicting FBG at peak time. The direction to change the FBG at peak
   time is predicted with a 70-90\% success rate. The amount of insulin
   administration is adjusted based on predicted FBG level. After
   predictive glycemic control (PGC) for around one year, the FBG average
   approached the normal range, standard deviation (SD) reduced by half,

   diabetes. To clarify how the beta cell mass is reduced, we performed
   adoptive transfer experiments and examined the relationship between the
   pancreatic status of NOD donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes
   into NOD-scid recipients. Methods-We killed 18-week-old female NOD mice
   (n = 20), removed their spleen, and transferred splenocytes into
   5-week-old female NOD-scid mice (n = 60). The relationship between the
   pancreatic status of donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes into
   recipients was assessed. As pancreatic status, we measured insulin
   content and severity of insulitis. Results-There was no linear
   correlation between the pancreatic status of donors and the time taken
   to transfer diabetes into recipients. NOD donors who needed 7 or more
   weeks to transfer diabetes in NOD-scid recipients had similar levels of
   insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of NOD donors who
   could not transfer diabetes. On the other hand, NOD donors who needed 6
   or less weeks to transfer diabetes in recipients had similar levels of
   insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of diabetic NOD mice.
   Conclusions-According to our observations, beta cell mass seems to be
   preserved until just before the onset of diabetes and decreased
   dramatically within a few weeks.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996, we designed a randomized multicenter study to assess the
   effects of small doses of insulin on beta cell failure in slowly
   progressive type 1 diabetes (the Tokyo Study). W report here the
   preliminary results of this study. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65
   antibody (GADA)-positive patients were randomly divided into 2 groups:
   one group received insulin (Ins group), the other a sulfonylurea (SU
   group). Fifty-four patients (24 Ins group, 30 SU group) were analyzed at
   the end of a 4-year period. All patients underwent a 75 g oral-glucose
   test (O-GTT) every 6-12 months. The insulin-dependent stage was defined
   based on an integrated value of serum C-peptide levels on O-GTT
   (SigmaCPR; sum of CPR at 0, 30,60,90, and 120 min) below 4.0 ng/mL. The
   SigmaCPR in the SU group decreased progressively from 22.0 +/- 10.6 to
   11.3 +/- 7.5 ng/mL over the 48-month period (p < 0.001 vs. baseline).
   The SigmaCPR in the Ins group was unchanged. Among the SU group, 30\% of
   subjects (9/30) progressed to IDDM, while 8.3\% of Ins group subjects
   (2/24) progressed to IDDM (P = 0.087). With regard to the subjects who
   had a preserved C-peptide response (SigmaCPR greater than or equal to 10
   ng/mL), the proportion of SU group subjects who progressed to IDDM was
   significantly higher than that of the Ins group (7/28, 25\% vs. 0/21,
   0\%, p = 0.015). Among subjects with a high GADA titer (greater than or
   equal to0 U/mL), 9/14 (64.3\%) of the SU group, but only 2/16 (12.5\%)
   of the Ins group, developed IDDM (p = 0.0068). As to those with a high
   GADA titer and a preserved C-peptide response, SU group subjects
   progressed to IDDM (7/12,58.3\%) more frequently than Ins group subjects
   (0/14, 0\%) (p = 0.0012). In summary, our results suggest that small
   doses of insulin effectively prevent beta cell failure in slowly
   progressive type 1 diabetes. We recommend avoiding SU treatment and
   instead administering insulin to NIDDM patients with high GADA titer.}},

   mellitus. approximately 90 to 95\% of them, i.e. 135 to 142 million are
   type-2 diabetic patients exhibiting the most important endogenous
   cardiovascular risk condition. The development of type-2 diabetes is a
   discontinuous process, featuring interactions between insulin resistance
   and insulin secretion. In a given case, it has - until now - been
   impossible neither to predict nor to establish retrospectively whether
   one of these latter items might have been the primary event or be
   dominant in the progression of type-2 diabetes. Therefore it is the aim
   of this study to assess in a given person the developmental stage along
   the pathway leading towards type-2 diabetes and to quantify the risk of
   worsening. The underlying rationale is based upon the hypothesis that
   the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes can be modelled mathematically and

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicated that glucose effectiveness (S-G) is
   overestimated and insulin sensitivity (S-I) is underestimated with the
   one-compartment minimal model (1CMM) of glucose kinetics. To correct
   these errors, Cobelli et al (1999), incorporated a priori knowledge on
   glucose exchange kinetics using the individual Bayesian estimation to
   derive S-I and S-G with the 2CMM during standard 1VGTT in healthy
   subjects. The present study evaluated 2CMM in subjects with type 2
   diabetes during insulin-modified 1VGTT and compared its performance with
   1CMM, and with the glucose clamp as the gold reference. The 2CMM
   measured the same S, and SG as the 1CMM and underestimated S, measured
   by the clamp. For its simplicity and popularity and to benefit from the
   data available in the literature 1CMM is preferred to 2CMM in type 2
   diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes mellitus is a common and precarious chronic disease, which
   affects cellular metabolism and energy production. The condition is
   divided into types I and 11; the most common form is type II diabetes,
   which is an adult-onset disease. Blood glucose testing is crucial to
   diabetes control, and it is effective in reducing the risk of
   complications and improving life quality. Unfortunately, both elderly
   patients and their caregivers find it difficult to monitor glucose
   levels long term. This study developed an integrated system for
   organizing and combining home glucose measurement, data transformation,
   and information integration. The developed system prompts diabetics to
   measure their blood glucose regularly at home, and provides remote
   caregivers with complete patient information for diagnosis and tracking.
   This aids in the improvement in diabetes control, thereby increasing the
   social activities and life quality of diabetics.}},

   dependent) diabetes, that alcohol intake at 2100 hrs significantly
   reduced blood glucose values after 10-12 hours, compared with control
   studies with no alcohol. We hypothesised that this was due to the
   following effects of alcohol: 1. Alcohol metabolism increases NADH,
   leading to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis; and 2. increased
   glycogen phosphorylase activity depletes hepatic glycogen stores; 3.
   After the alcohol is metabolised, hepatic insulin sensitivity is
   increased, leading to the restoration of glycogen stores and reduction
   in blood glucose levels, and 4. consequently, after several hours,
   glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity return to normal. A model
   describing these changes (DiasNet-Alcohol) was implemented into the
   DiasNet model of human glucose metabolism. Our study suggests that the
   DiasNet-Alcohol model gives a reasonable approximation of the effect of
   alcohol on blood glucose concentration observed in our study and
   supports our hypothesis for the mechanism behind these effects in Type 1
   diabetes.}},

   were divided in subgroups of 4 or 5 patients and was instructed by the
   dietitian how to estimate the CHO intake and by the doctor in the use of
   the Accutrend DM(R) blood glucose meter. During a 3 days data collecting
   period the patients were asked to keep a written diary containing a
   description of the meals, the estimated CHO intake, the insulin-dosage
   and the time of the meals and insulin injections, and to make 8-point
   blood glucose profiles daily. They were furthermore asked to use the log
   function of the Accutrend DM(R) blood glucose meter. At the second visit
   the data were discussed individually with the patients and if there
   where more than three data points missing using the log function the
   patients were asked to repeat the data collection. A deviation of 10
   grams or more, between the patient's and the dietician's estimate, was
   seen in 7.3\% of the meals following the first instruction, in 1.0\% of
   the meals following the second instruction, and in 2.4\% of the meals

   development of autoimmune diabetes: (1) Diet modifies the incidence of
   autoimmune diabetes and the phenotype of the islet-infiltrating T cells
   in the animal models of human type 1 diabetes; (2) gut-associated homing
   receptor beta7-integrin is found on the islet-infiltrating T cells in
   both human type 1 diabetes and in the animal models of autoimmune
   diabetes; (3) mesenterial lymphocytes from young NOD mice are able to
   transfer diabetes to healthy recipients; (4) autoantigen feeding
   modifies the disease development in the animal models (prevents or
   accelerates autoimmune diabetes). In humans, a link between the gut
   immune system and type 1 diabetes has also been suggested. Early
   introduction of cow milk formulas in infancy may increase the risk of
   type 1 diabetes. We have demonstrated that primary immunization to a
   beta cell-specific autoantigen, insulin, occurs in the gut by exposure
   to cow milk formulas, which contain immunogenic bovine insulin. The
   induced antibody and T cell responses to bovine insulin cross-react with
   human insulin. In children at genetic risk who developed beta cell
   autoimmunity, bovine insulin-binding antibodies increased during
   follow-up in contrast to autoantibody-negative children. This suggests
   that insulin-specific immune response induced by dietary insulin may not
   be controlled in children prone to beta cell autoimmunity. The gut
   immune system has a key role in controlling insulin-specific immunity
   induced by dietary insulin. Indeed, indications for aberrant function of
   the gut immune system have been reported in type 1 diabetes, such as
   intestinal immune activation and increased intestinal permeability.
   Research on the gut immune system in human type 1 diabetes is needed to
   reveal the role of oral immunity in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of patients with
   gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who have serological markers typical
   of autoimmune type 1 DM. The specific pancreatic markers, ICAs, glutamic
   decarboxylase (GADAbs), and second islet antigen (IA2Abs), were measured
   in 70 women with GDM during the pregnancy and after delivery. WAS were
   measured by indirect immunofluorescence and GADAbs and IA2Abs were
   determined by a radiobinding assay with recombinant antigens. On
   entering the study, 1 of 70 (1.4\%) patients was positive for both ICAs
   (80 JDF-U) and GADAbs (167 U/mL), while another (1.4\%) was positive for
   WAS (40 JDF-U). None of the patients was positive for IA2Abs. During
   follow-up, positivity was maintained unchanged in the two positive
   patients. Four previously negative patients had seroconversion: one for
   both WAS (20 JDF-U) and GADAbs (49.3 U/mL) and the other three for
   GADAbs (1.8, 1.4, and 15.3 U/mL, respectively). The IA2Abs remained
   negative in all patients. Overall, during the observation period 6 of 70
   (8.6\%) patients had or developed autoantibodies against endocrine
   pancreas. During follow-up 15 patients developed clinical DM (10 type 2,
   5 type 1) and 7 demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after
   OGTT. No correlations were demonstrated between the immunological
   patterns and the evolution in DM. In patients with GDM, the frequency of
   pancreatic antoantibodies varies during the pregnancy and after
   delivery, but a small subgroup of patients bearing these markers is
   identifiable. GDM is a complex syndrome, constituted by different types
   of diabetes mellitus where the autoimmune form is very rare.}},

Abstract = {{Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is associated with specific
   high-risk HLA DQ and DR haplotypes and islet cell antibodies. IDDM
   susceptibility in Caucasians is more strongly associated with DQ2/DQ8
   (DQA1{*}0501-DQB1{*}0201/DQA1{*}0301-DQB1{*}0302) and DQ6 (B1{*}0604)
   than with DRB1{*}03/DRB1{*}04, while a single copy of DQ6 (B1{*}0602)
   gives sufficient protection against type 1 diabetes. As a part of the
   ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden) study we have done typing of DQA1,
   DQB1, and DRB1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the
   second exon of the genes, manually dot-blotting onto nylon membranes
   synthetic sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes,
   3'-end-labeling with P-32-dCTP, and hybridization followed by stringency
   washes and autoradiography using the SSO probe. Among 3756 newborns born
   in southeast Sweden we have found the high-risk genotype DQ2/DR3-DO8/DR4
   to be present in 1\%, haplotype DQ8/DR4 in 7.8\%, and haplotype DQ2JDR3
   in 9.6\%. DQ2/DR3 or DQ8/DR4 was carried by 16.4\% of newborns; the
   low-risk DQ6 molecule was carried by newborns as follows:
   DQ2/DR3-DQ6/DR15, 1.3\%; DQ8/DR4-DQ6/DR15, 1.3\%; and DQ6/DR15, 9.4\%.
   We conclude from our results that the high incidence of IDDM in Sweden
   is at least in part due to increased prevalence of high-risk HLA
   haplotypes compared to protective haplotypes (20\% vs. 13\%) in the
   general population.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is positively associated with
   HLA-DQ8, DQ2, and DQ6 (B{*}0604) and negatively with DQ6 (B{*}0602). The
   mechanisms by which the DQ molecules control the development of IDDM is
   not known. DQ6 (B{*}0602) and DQ6 (B{*}0604) molecules share the same
   DQalpha chain but differ in the beta chain by six residues at positions
   9, 30, 57, 70, 86, and 87. The aim of the study was to sequence the
   peptides eluted from both DQ6 molecules and to determine the binding
   motifs and construct peptides for docking them into the DQ6 peptide
   binding groove by molecular modeling. EBV transformed B cell line
   homozygous for DQ6 and hybridoma cell line secreting DQ6 specific
   antibody were grown in large-scale culture. The DQ6 molecules were
   precipitated with solid-phase bound antibodies specific for DQ6. The
   dissociation of peptides from MHC was done with ultrafiltration and
   separation of peptides by reversed-phase HPLC, using Edman degradation.
   A special application of Edman degradation is pool sequencing. This
   approach allowed us to determine common characteristics of all peptides
   associated with a given MHC molecule. The precipitation of DQ6 molecules
   and the peptide elution were done successfully. The sequencing of the
   peptides from DQ6 (B{*}0602) identified three fractions: (1)
   IINEPTAAAIAYGLD (Bovine HSP70), (2) IINEPTAAAIAGLDR (Human HSP70), and
   (3) NPRDAKACVVHGSDLK (Na+/K+ ATPase). Peptide eluted from DQ6 (B{*}0604)
   had a sequence ADLFRGTLDPVEK with sequence homology to HSP70 (residues
   307-319). We were able to predict the motifs for DQ6 from the ligands
   eluted. We used molecular modeling as a tool to identify plausible
   binding motifs for peptides. Our studies show that peptide ADLFRGTLDPVEK
   and NPRDAKACVVHGSDLK fit well in the respective DQ6 binding grooves.
   These predicted motifs should then be useful for screening of
   autoantigens associated with diabetes and identifying the epitopes that
   are likely to interact with T cells.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-based approaches to the discovery of genes contributing to the
   development of type 2 diabetes have not been very successful despite
   substantial investments of time and money. The multiple gene-gene and
   gene-environment interactions that influence the development of type 2
   diabetes mean that DNA approaches are not the ideal tool for defining
   the etiology of this complex disease. Gene expression-based technologies
   may prove to be a more rewarding strategy to identify diabetes candidate
   genes. There are a number of RNA-based technologies available to
   identify genes that are differentially expressed in various tissues in
   type 2 diabetes. These include differential display polymerase chain
   reaction (ddPCR), suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and cDNA
   microarrays. The power of new technologies to detect differential gene
   expression is ideally suited to studies utilizing appropriate animal
   models of human disease. We have shown that the gene expression
   approach, in combination with an excellent animal model such as the
   Israeli sand rat (Psammomys obesus), can provide novel genes and
   pathways that may be important in the disease process and provide novel
   therapeutic approaches. This paper will describe a new gene discovery,
   beacon, a novel gene linked with energy intake. As the functional
   characterization of novel genes discovered in our laboratory using this
   approach continues, it is anticipated that we will soon be able to
   compile a definitive list of genes that are important in the development
   of obesity and type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive diabetes treatment can lead to a substantial reduction of the
   rate of the complications associated with diabetes. However, a number of
   patients may have poor control despite specialist care, and this along
   with devolution of care to non-specialists suggests that alternative
   interventions should be developed. The present paper describes an
   Internet based system where more emphasis is put on patient empowerment,
   the keywords being education and communication. The DiasNet system is
   based on a well documented decision support system, Dias, designed for
   use by clinicians. The scope of DiasNet has been widened from being used
   by clinicians to give advice on insulin dose, to also being used by
   patients as a tool for education and communication. Patients can
   experiment with their own data, adjusting insulin doses or meal sizes.
   In this way different therapeutic and dietary alternatives can be tried
   out, allowing the patient to gain experience in achieving glycaemic
   control. DiasNet is implemented in JAVA according to the client/server
   principle, enabling a new way of communication between patient and
   clinician: in case of any problems, the patient simply phones the
   clinician, who immediately, using his or her office PC, can take a look
   at the data the patient has entered. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nine type 1 diabetic patients were studied for 24 hours. During this
   period they were given three calibrated meals. The glycemia was
   feedback-controlled by means of an artificial pancreas. The blood
   concentration of glucose and the infusion speed of the insulin were
   measured every minute. The experimental data referring to each of the
   three meals were used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model
   suitable for describing the glycemic response of diabetic patients at
   meals and at the i.v. infusion of exogenous insulin. From the estimate a
   marked dispersion of the parameters was found, both interindividual and
   intraindividual. Nevertheless the models thus obtained seem to be usable
   for the synthesis of a feedback controller, especially in view of
   creating a portable artificial pancreas that now seems possible owing to
   the realization (so far experimental) of sufficiently reliable glucose
   concentration sensors.}},

   determined by following parameters: nitrogen balance, glucose and
   insulin change during weight reduction. Early ketone bodies forming in
   obesity is an example of dual reaction. The first phase of ketone bodies
   response is a quick reaction to insulin level decrease. The second phase
   forms a plateau with steady state of betahydroxybutyrate forming and
   metabolic extraction. A model with derivative regulator should be used
   for modelling of ketone forming in obesity and diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{A cure for diabetes has long been sought using several different
   approaches, including islet transplantation, regeneration of beta cells
   and insulin gene therapy(1). However, permanent remission of type 1
   diabetes has not yet been satisfactorily achieved. The development of
   type 1 diabetes results from the almost total destruction of
   insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells by autoimmune responses specific
   to beta cells(2-6). Standard insulin therapy may not maintain blood
   glucose concentrations within the relatively narrow range that occurs in
   the presence of normal pancreatic beta cells(7). We used a recombinant
   adeno-associated virus (rAAV) that expresses a single-chain insulin
   analogue (SIA), which possesses biologically active insulin activity
   without enzymatic conversion, under the control of hepatocyte-specific
   L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoter, which regulates SIA expression in
   response to blood glucose levels. Here we show that SIA produced from
   the gene construct rAAV-LPK-SIA caused remission of diabetes in
   streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and autoimmune diabetic mice for a
   prolonged time without any apparent side effects. This new SIA gene
   therapy may have potential therapeutic value for the cure of autoimmune
   diabetes in humans.}},

Abstract = {{DIABNET is a knowledge-based system designed to aid doctors with therapy
   planning in gestational diabetes. The system core is a qualitative
   model, implemented by a Causal Probabilistic Network, that is able to
   detect the insulin effectiveness on a daily basis. DIABNET analyses
   monitoring data and proposes quantitative changes in insulin therapy and
   qualitative diet modifications. This paper proposes an evaluation
   methodology to assess the system performance when working in a real
   scenario. The methodology manages the absence of a gold standard and
   includes. a subjective analysis based on questionnaires and an objective
   analysis based on a quantitative comparison of the system's and experts'
   proposals. The paper also shows the results of two experiments in which
   expert diabetologists evaluated the therapeutical advice provided by
   DIABNET during the follow up of 9 patients with gestational diabetes.
   DIABNET detected the need of a therapy modification in 92\% of the cases
   showing its appropriateness for automatic alarm generation. Around 80\%
   of the proposals were accepted by experts. The evaluation results are
   encouraging and allow characterisation of the system's performance when
   proposing therapy modifications. Evaluation in its turn helps to refine
   the knowledge managed by DIABNET and enables us to look towards the
   further clinical use of DIABNET as a decision tool in gestational
   diabetes integrated in a telemedicine service. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   Records Function offers options for the management of the EHCRs
   (creation/correction/visualization), such as registration of a new
   patient and recording of his first Basic Information Sheet; the
   recording of a new sheet; the correction/visualization of the sheet; the
   recording of data about the patient's death, etc. The System

   sheets; the management of passwords and access rights for the users; the
   management of units used for measurements; the management of the

Abstract = {{This study concerns whether advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) are
   related to microvascular derangement in diabetes, exemplified by
   pericyte loss and angiogenesis in retinopathy and by mesangial expansion
   in nephropathy, AGE caused a decrease in viable pericytes cultivated
   from bovine retina. On the other hand, AGE stimulated the growth and
   tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells (EC), this being
   mediated by autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor. In AGE-exposed
   rat mesangial cells, type TV collagen synthesis was induced, Those AGE
   actions were dependent on a cell surface receptor for AGE (RAGE),
   because they were abolished by RAGE antisense or ribozyme, The AGE-RAGE
   system may thus participate in the development of diabetic
   microangiopathy. This proposition was supported by experiments with
   animal models; several indices characteristic of retinopathy were
   correlated with circulating AGE levels in OLETF rats. The predisposition
   to nephropathy was augmented in RAGE transgenic mice when they became
   diabetic.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases and it often leads to a
   substantial loss of quality of life. However, complications can be
   relieved by intensive insulin treatment, which, unfortunately, also
   increases the frequency severe hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), In
   1959 Somogyi described how insulin overtreatment, leading to
   hypoglycaemia, can cause prolonged hyperglycaemia (elevated blood
   glucose), but numerous studies, especially in the 80ies, have not been
   able to produce significant evidence for his theory, However, in a
   recent model-based study we have introduced a hypothesis suggesting that
   the phenomenon is clinically much more important than previously
   anticipated. The present pilot study assesses the feasibility of
   employing a computer model to data from a 32 hour intensive monitoring
   period from 3 patients to infer the reaction to spontaneous
   hypoglycaemia, thereby contributing to the verification of the
   hypothesis and to an understanding of the phenomenon. Regarded
   separately, the number of patients in the present study is far to small
   to justify any conclusion, but, taken together with our previous
   studies, there seems to be substantial evidence for the existence of the
   hypoglycaemic counter-regulation. Furthermore, the present study seems
   to suggest that cortisol release, triggered by the hypoglycaemic attack,
   may play an important role in provoking the hypoglycaemic
   counter-regulation, and that further studies are clearly required to
   verify this hypothesis.}},
