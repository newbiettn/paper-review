Abstract = {Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires lifelong medical treatments and a life style adjustment. To prevent serious morbidity and mortality, it requires dedication to demanding self-care behaviors in multiple domains. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of self care behaviors among patients with diabetes. Methods: From a total of 425 follow up diabetic patients, a quantitative cross sectional study was conducted among 222 of them from three different hospitals in Harar town, from March to April, 2011. The sample was taken using simple random sampling method. Data was collected using pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics multiple logistic regression analysis were also used to assess the predicators of self care behaviors among patients with diabetes. Result: Majority of the study respondents 134 (60.4\%) were female and the mean age was 49.7 (SD +/- 14.7) years. More than half 147(66.2\%) of them were medically diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. 208(93.7\%) had general knowledge about diabetes and specific knowledge about diabetes self care 207(93.2\%). Large proportion of them had moderate perceived susceptibility 174(78.4\%) and severity 112(50.5\%). More than half of the respondents 149(67.1\%) had less perceived barrier while only 30 (13.5\%) of them had high self efficacy to self care practices related to diabetes mellitus. Only 87(39.2\%) followed the recommended self care practices on diabetes. Conclusions: Patients with less frequent information were less likely to take diabetes self care. Patients who were more educated, middle income, had high perceived severity of diabetes and less perceived barrier to self care were more likely to take diabetes self care. To increase the self care behavior, diabetes messages should focus on severity of diabetes and how to overcome barriers for self care by segmenting the audiences based on income and educational status with increasing the frequency and reach of message on diabetes.},

Abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in populations of European ancestry have mapped a type 2 diabetes susceptibility region to chromosome 10q23.33 containing IDE, KIF11 and HHEX genes (IDE-KIF11-HHEX), which has also been replicated in Chinese populations. However, the functional relevance for genetic variants at this locus is still unclear. It is critical to systematically assess the relationship of genetic variants in this region with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings: A fine-mapping study was conducted by genotyping fourteen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 290-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) region using a two-stage case-control study of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population. Suggestive associations (P<0.05) observed from 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls in the first stage were further replicated in 1,725 cases and 2,081 controls in the second stage. Seven tagging SNPs were consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in both stages (P<0.05), with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.14 to 1.33 in the combined analysis. The most significant locus was rs7923837 [OR = 1.33, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.47] at the 3'-flanking region of HHEX gene. SNP rs1111875 was found to be another partially independent locus (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.13-1.35) in this region that was associated with type 2 diabetes risk. A cumulative effect of rs7923837 and rs1111875 was observed with individuals carrying 1, 2, and 3 or 4 risk alleles having a 1.27, 1.44, and 1.73-fold increased risk, respectively, for type 2 diabetes (P for trend = 4.1E-10). Conclusions/Significance: Our results confirm that genetic variants of the IDE-KIF11-HHEX region at 10q23.33 contribute to type 2 diabetes susceptibility and suggest that rs7923837 may represent the strongest signal related to type 2 diabetes risk in the Chinese Han population.},

Abstract = {Leukocyte telomere length (TL) is considered a biomarker for biological aging. Shortened TL has been observed in many complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Lifestyle intervention studies, e. g. the Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), have shown a decrease in the incidence of T2DM by promoting healthy lifestyles in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Our aim was to study in the DPS the influence of the lifestyle intervention on TL. TL was measured by quantitative PCR-based method at two time points (N = 334 and 343) on average 4.5 years apart during the active intervention and post-intervention follow-up. TL inversely correlated with age. Our main finding was that TL increased in about two thirds of the individuals both in the intervention and in the control groups during follow-up; TL increased most in individuals with the shortest TL at the first measurement. TL was not associated with development of T2DM, nor did lifestyle intervention have an effect on TL. No association between insulin secretion or insulin resistance indices and TL was observed. We did not detect an association between TL and development of T2DM in the DPS participants. It could be due to all participants being overweight and having IGT at baseline, both of which have been found to be independently associated with shorter leukocyte TL in some earlier studies. TL had no substantial role in worsening of glucose tolerance in people with IGT. Our study confirms that leukocyte TL can increase with time even in obese people with impaired glucose metabolism.},

Abstract = {Background: Disruption of endogenous circadian rhythms has been shown to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, suggesting that circadian genes might play a role in determining disease susceptibility. We present the results of a pilot study investigating the association between type 2 diabetes and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in/near nine circadian genes. The variants were chosen based on their previously reported association with prostate cancer, a disease that has been suggested to have a genetic link with type 2 diabetes through a number of shared inherited risk determinants. Methodology/Principal Findings:The pilot study was performed using two genetically homogeneous Punjabi cohorts, one resident in the United Kingdom and one indigenous to Pakistan. Subjects with (N = 1732) and without (N = 1780) type 2 diabetes were genotyped for thirteen circadian variants using a competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. Associations between the SNPs and type 2 diabetes were investigated using logistic regression. The results were also combined with in silico data from other South Asian datasets (SAT2D consortium) and white European cohorts (DIAGRAM+) using meta-analysis. The rs7602358G allele near PER2 was negatively associated with type 2 diabetes in our Punjabi cohorts (combined odds ratio [OR]= 0.75 [0.66-0.86], p = 3.18 x 10(-5)), while the BMAL1 rs11022775T allele was associated with an increased risk of the disease (combined OR = 1.22 [1.07-1.39], p = 0.003). Neither of these associations was replicated in the SAT2D or DIAGRAM+ datasets, however. Meta-analysis of all the cohorts identified disease associations with two variants, rs2292912 in CRY2 and rs12315175 near CRY1, although statistical significance was nominal (combined OR 1.05 [1.01-1.08], p = 0.008 and OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.99], p = 0.015 respectively). Conclusions/significance: None of the selected circadian gene variants was associated with type 2 diabetes with study-wide significance after meta-analysis. The nominal association observed with the CRY2 SNP, however, complements previous findings and confirms a role for this locus in disease susceptibility.},

Abstract = {Background: Genetic variability of the major subunit (CACNA1E) of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel Ca(V)2.3 is associated to risk of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in nondiabetic subjects. The aim of the study was to test whether CACNA1E common variability affects beta cell function and/or insulin sensitivity in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings: In 595 GAD-negative, drug naive patients (mean +/- SD; age: 58.5 +/- 10.2 yrs; BMI: 29.9 +/- 5 kg/m(2), HbA1c: 7.0 +/- 1.3) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes we: 1. genotyped 10 tag SNPs in CACNA1E region reportedly covering similar to 93\% of CACNA1E common variability: rs558994, rs679931, rs2184945, rs10797728, rs3905011, rs12071300, rs175338, rs3753737, rs2253388 and rs4652679; 2. assessed clinical phenotypes, insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp and beta cell function by state-of-art modelling of glucose/C-peptide curves during OGTT. Five CACNA1E tag SNPs (rs10797728, rs175338, rs2184945, rs3905011 and rs4652679) were associated with specific aspects of beta cell function (p<0.05-0.01). Both major alleles of rs2184945 and rs3905011 were each (p<0.01 and p<0.005, respectively) associated to reduced proportional control with a demonstrable additive effect (p<0.005). In contrast, only the major allele of rs2253388 was related weakly to more severe insulin resistance (p<0.05). Conclusions/Significance: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes CACNA1E common variability is strongly associated to beta cell function. Genotyping CACNA1E might be of help to infer the beta cell functional phenotype and to select a personalized treatment.},

Abstract = {Background: Adherence to prescribed medications is a key dimension of healthcare quality. The aim of this large population-based study was to evaluate self-reported medication adherence and to identify factors linked with poor adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes in France. Methodology: The ENTRED study 2007, a French national survey of people treated for diabetes, was based on a representative sample of patients who claimed reimbursement for oral hypoglycaemic agents and/or insulin at least three times between August 2006 and July 2007, and who were randomly selected from the database of the two main National Health Insurance Systems. Medication adherence was determined using a six-item self-administered questionnaire. A multinomial polychotomous logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with medication adherence in the 3,637 persons with type 2 diabetes. Principal Findings: Thirty nine percent of patients reported good medication adherence, 49\% medium adherence and 12\% poor adherence. The factors significantly associated with poor adherence in multivariate analysis were socio-demographic factors: age <45 years, non-European geographical origin, financial difficulties and being professionally active; disease and therapy-related factors: HbA(1c) > 8\% and existing diabetes complications; and health care-related factors: difficulties for taking medication alone, decision making by the patient only, poor acceptability of medical recommendations, lack of family or social support, need for information on treatment, reporting no confidence in the future, need for medical support and follow-up by a specialist physician. Conclusions: In a country with a high level of access to healthcare, our study demonstrated a substantial low level of medication adherence in type 2 diabetic patients. Better identification of those with poor adherence and individualised suitable recommendations remain essential for better healthcare management.},

Abstract = {Objective Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require high specificity and large numbers of subjects to identify genotype-phenotype correlations accurately. The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes (T2D) cases and controls for a GWAS, using data captured through routine clinical care across five institutions using different electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Materials and Methods An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results. The performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating institutions compared against clinician review. A GWAS was subsequently performed using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across all five institutions. Results The algorithm achieved 98\% and 100\% positive predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as compared against clinician review. By standardizing and applying the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified. Subsequent GWAS using data from five institutions replicated the TCF7L2 gene variant (rs7903146) previously associated with T2D. Discussion By applying stringent criteria to EMR data collected through routine clinical care, cases and controls for a GWAS were identified that subsequently replicated a known genetic variant. The use of standard terminologies to define data elements enabled pooling of subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the robust numbers required for GWAS. Conclusions An algorithm using commonly available data from five different EMR can accurately identify T2D cases and controls for genetic study across multiple institutions.},

Abstract = {Objective: The effect of smoking cessation on the risk of diabetes has been reported previously. However, it is unknown whether the association is influenced by weight gain and other potential risk factors. Methods: The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study established in 1990 for Cohort I and in 1993 for Cohort II provided data, and 25,875 men and 33,959 women were analyzed. The response rate to the baseline questionnaire was 80.9\%, and 68.4\% of the respondents participated both the 5- and 10-year follow-up surveys. Smoking cessation was noted during the initial five years and the development of diabetes was reported in the subsequent five years. Results: An increased risk was observed among individuals who newly quit smoking compared with never smokers among men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.03-1.94) and women (OR = 2.84, CI = 1.53-5.29). The risk of developing diabetes among male new quitters who gained 3 kg or more during the 5-year follow-up did not substantially differ from the risk among male never smokers with less than 3 kg of weight gain or no weight gain, while an increased risk was observed among male new quitters with less or no weight gain (OR = 1.46, 95\% CI 1.00-2.14). An insignificant increased risk was observed among male new quitters with a family history of diabetes compared with male never smokers with a family history of diabetes. The risk was more than twice as high for male new quitters who used to smoke 25 or more cigarettes per day compared with never smokers (OR = 2.15, 95\% CI: 1.34-3.47). Discussion: An increased risk of diabetes was implied among individuals who quit smoking. However, the increased risk was not implied among those who gained weight over the 5-years of follow-up. Those who had major risk factors for diabetes or who smoked heavier had a higher risk.},

Abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to determine predictors that influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a large cohort of elderly diabetes patients from primary care over a follow-up period of five years. Methods and Results: At the baseline measurement of the ESTHER cohort study (2000-2002), 1375 out of 9953 participants suffered from diabetes (13.8\%). 1057 of these diabetes patients responded to the second-follow up (2005-2007). HRQOL at baseline and follow-up was measured using the SF-12; mental component scores (MCS) and physical component scores (PCS) were calculated; multiple linear regression models were used to determine predictors of HRQOL at follow-up. As possible predictors for HRQOL, the following baseline variables were examined: treatment with insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), number of diabetes related complications, number of comorbid diseases, Body-Mass-Index (BMI), depression and HRQOL. Regression analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and smoking status. 1034 patients (97.8\%) responded to the SF-12 both at baseline and after five years and were therefore included in the study. Regression analyses indicated that significant predictors of decreased MCS were a lower HRQOL, a higher number of diabetes related complications and a reported history of depression at baseline. Complications, BMI, smoking and HRQOL at baseline significantly predicted PCS at the five year follow-up. Conclusions: Our findings expand evidence from previous cross-sectional data indicating that in elderly diabetes patients, depression, diabetes related complications, smoking and BMI are temporally predictive for HRQOL.},

Abstract = {Background: The effect of glycemic control after starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) on the survival of diabetic PD patients has largely been unexplored, especially in Asian population. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study, in which 140 incident PD patients with diabetes were recruited. Patients were divided into tertiles according to the means of quarterly HbA1C levels measured during the first year after starting PD. We examined the association between HbA1C and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The mean age was 58.7 years, 59.3\% were male, and the mean follow-up duration was 3.5 years (range 0.4-9.5 years). The mean HbA1C levels were 6.3\%, 7.1\%, and 8.5\% in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertiles, respectively. Compared to the 1st tertile, the all-cause mortality rates were higher in the 2nd [hazard ratio (HR), 4.16; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-18.94; p = 0.065] and significantly higher in the 3rd (HR, 13.16; 95\% CI, 2.67-64.92; p = 0.002) tertiles (p for trend = 0.005), after adjusting for confounding factors. Cardiovascular mortality, however, did not differ significantly among the tertiles (p for trend = 0.682). In contrast, non-cardiovascular deaths, most of which were caused by infection, were more frequent in the 2nd (HR, 7.67; 95\% CI, 0.68-86.37; p = 0.099) and the 3rd (HR, 51.24; 95\% CI, 3.85-681.35; p = 0.003) tertiles than the 1st tertile (p for trend = 0.007). Conclusions: Poor glycemic control is associated with high mortality rates in diabetic PD patients, suggesting that better glycemic control may improve the outcomes of these patients.},

Abstract = {Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes is very important for developing diabetes prediction tools instead of blood testing. Recently, many researches have studied risk factors of diabetes in order to apply them to be a tool for diabetes prediction by using Logistic Regression (LR), Radial Basis and Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN). However, the accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH, Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35\%, 83.5\%, 83.6\% and 83.65\%, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the baseline up to 1.2\%.},

Abstract = {In today's world the diabetes mellitus has become a major health problem among the people of all ages. Most of the researchers have proposed different systems to diagnose diabetes, in spite of which the accuracy of the prediction rate of diabetes is not so significant. Most of the techniques suggested were to detect diabetes associated with the parts of the body such as eye, heart or legs. All the developed systems aimed to identify diabetes by increasing the accuracy of the prediction rate but fail to do so in most of the cases as there were some issues that had not been discussed. The existing systems had number of drawbacks like some were only concentrated for women and who were less than 21 years old [5], some gave greater accuracy if only one data set was used [6], some needed dataset of very good quality [12], some needed to standardize the ontology [10] and some even failed to show the performance of the developed systems [7]. So there is an need to develop a diabetes diagnosis system that improves the accuracy of the prediction rate by considering all the factors into account. This paper presents a novel approach for diagnosis of diabetes which has two stages to predict the diabetes status. The initial prediction stage adopts two computational intelligence and knowledge engineering techniques such as fuzzy logic (F), neural network (N) and case based reasoning (C) as an individual approach (FCN). The final prediction stage applies rule based algorithm to the values obtained from the initial stage. The benefit of applying these stages is that the accuracy of prediction rate will be higher when compared to using only the initial prediction stage done by most of the suggested systems for predicting the occurrence of diabetes mellitus.

Abstract = {In this study, an individualized predictive model of the subcutaneous glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes is presented, which relies on the Random Forests regression technique. A multivariate dataset is utilized concerning the s.c. glucose profile, the plasma insulin concentration, the intestinal absorption of meal-derived glucose and the daily energy expenditure. In an attempt to capture daily rhythms in glucose metabolism, we also introduce a time feature in the predictive analysis. The dataset comes from the continuous multi-day recordings of 27 type 1 patients in free-living conditions. Evaluating the performance of the proposed method by 10-fold cross validation, an average RMSE of 6.60, 8.15, 9.25 and 10.83 mg/dl for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min prediction horizons, respectively, was attained.},

Abstract = {Currently, Diabetes is a very common disease around the world, and with an increase in sedentary lifestyles, obesity and an aging population the number of people with Diabetes worldwide will increase by more than 50\%. In this context, the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Teehnology) developed the SANA platform, which brings the benefits of information technology to the field of healthcare. It offers healthcare delivery in remote areas, improves patient access to medical specialists for faster, higher quality, and more cost effective diagnosis and intervention. For these reasons, we developed a system for diagnosis of Diabetes using the SANA platform, called S2DIA. It is the first step towards knowing the risks for type 2 Diabetes, and it will be evaluated, especially, in remote/poor areas of Brazil.},

Abstract = {Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, is the most common complication experienced by Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients. It is dangerous and can result in unconsciousness, seizures and even death. The most common physiological parameter to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction are heart rate (HR) and correct QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Based on physiological parameters, an intelligent diagnostics system, using the hybrid approach of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemia. The proposed ANFIS is characterized by adaptive neural network capabilities and the fuzzy inference system. To optimize the membership functions and adaptive network parameters, a global learning optimization algorithm called hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is used. For clinical study, 15 children with Type 1 diabetes volunteered for an overnight study. All the real data sets are collected from the Department of Health, Government of Western Australia. Several experiments were conducted with 5 patients each, for a training set (184 data points), a validation set (192 data points) and a testing set (153 data points), which are randomly selected. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method is found to be satisfactory by giving better sensitivity, 79.09\% and acceptable specificity, 51.82\%.},

Abstract = {Health examination has played an important role for maintaining people's health since it can not only help people understand their own health conditions clearly but also avoid missing the best timing of disease treatment. However, in current health examination systems, people get only a basic report from single health examination and no advanced health risk analysis is provided. In this paper, we proposed an effective mechanism for chronic disease risk prediction by mining the data containing historical health records and personal life style information. Value change trends of the data are important for disease status prediction, and we defined significant ones as health risk patterns in our mechanism. Risks of a chronic disease can be predicted early with a mechanism built with our health risk patterns and it also proven work well through experimental evaluations on real datasets. Our method outperformed traditional mechanism in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity for predicting the risk of diabetes. In particular, insightful observations show that the consideration of life-style information can effectively enhance whole performance for risk prediction. Moreover, classification rules produced by our mechanism which integrates C4.5 and CBA provide physicians disease related health risk patterns such that appropriate treatments could be given to people for disease prevention.},

Abstract = {The identification of causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for complex diseases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a challenge because of the low statistical power of individual markers from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). SNP combinations are suggested to compensate for the low statistical power of individual markers, but SNP combinations from GWAS generate high computational complexity. Hence, we aim to detect T2D causal SNP combinations from a GWAS dataset with optimal filtration and to discover the biological meaning of the detected SNP combinations. Optimal filtration can enhance the statistical power of SNP combinations by comparing the error rates of SNP combinations from various Bonferroni thresholds and p-value range-based thresholds combined with linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning. T2D causal SNP combinations are selected using random forests with variable selection from an optimal SNP dataset. The selected SNPs with SNP combinations are mapped with multi-dimensional levels of T2D-related information and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A T2D causal SNP combination containing 101 SNPs from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS dataset are selected, with an error rate of 10.25\%. Matching with known disease genes and gene sets revealed the relationships between T2D and SNP combinations. We propose a detection method for complex disease causal SNP combinations from an optimal SNP dataset by using random forests with variable selection. Mapping the biological meanings of detected SNP combinations can help uncover complex disease mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This article presents initial results of a chemically induced diabetic swine model. A Gottingen minipig was equipped with a commercially available subcutaneous measuring glucose sensor and an insulin pump. Blood and subcutaneous glucose concentrations were observed during healthy and diabetic periods. Induction of stable diabetes mellitus by Streptozocin injection was confirmed by oral glucose tolerance test. The measurements showed, that blood glucose level in Gottingen minipigs is in a similar range, albeit discretely lower compared to human subjects. Subcutaneous and intravenous glucose concentration were similar but differing. In the future, it seems to be reasonable to use a swine model as intermediate translational step between in-silica and human trials for the validation of control algorithms for blood glucose control.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to determine the suitability of a swine breed with leptin resistance and predisposition to obesity (the Iberian pig) as model for studies on metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Thus, six Iberian sows had ad libitum access to food enriched with saturated fat (SFAD group; food consumption was estimated to be 4.5 kg/animal/day) whilst four females acted as controls and were fed with 2 kg/animal/day of a commercial maintenance diet. After three months of differential feeding, SFAD animals developed central obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated blood pressure; the five parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome. Thus, the current study characterizes the Iberian pig as a robust, amenable, and reliable translational model for studies on nutrition-associated diseases.},

Abstract = {Diabetes, which ranks 4th among the top ten causes of death in Taiwan, is one of the most important medical issues in the 21st century. However, for most diabetic patients, their blood sugar is not under good control, especially in ICUs. Good control of blood sugar may reduce the risk of sepsis to 34\% for patients in ICUs. The importance of good blood sugar control for patients in ICUs is manifested by a significant reduction of mortality and morbidity. This study designed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) using a support vector machine (SVM) to predict if a critically ill patient can have good glucose control after insulin administration. A filter method based on logistic regression analysis (LRA) and a wrapper method based on recursive feature elimination (RFE) were adopted to select salient features from 10 variables for CDSS design. Data on 231 patients (2492 records) were collected covering four years from an ICU. Four significant variables (p < 0.05) using LRA in contrast to five ones using RFE algorithm, were selected. The results show that the predictive accuracy under cross-validation was 93.50\% for features selected with LRA, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with SVM-RFE were 95.75\%, 92.71\% and 99.81\%, respectively. It could predict the outcome quite accurately after having injected a certain dose of insulin. The proposed system may help doctors effectively assess their patients in determining insulin dose for better glucose control in an ICU setting.},

Abstract = {Purpose: There are few opportunities to study the use of integrated electronic health record (EHR) systems, where single patient records are used by a number of health care staff. The purpose of the study was to understand how an integrated electronic health record system was used by health care staff in the treatment and management of diabetes patients. The investigation was focused on the interface between the primary and secondary care services which patients access for their diabetes care. Methods: Observations of the use of an integrated electronic health record during patients' consultations with health care staff were conducted over a three month period. Twelve patients were followed through their consultations with a range of health care staff at a secondary care Diabetes Centre and in primary care settings. A thematic analysis of the observation data was undertaken. Results: The integrated electronic health record system had been implemented across the primary and secondary care interface and was used by many, but not all, clinicians involved in the care of patients with diabetes. In some areas of care it enabled health care staff to access more accurate and detailed information to inform their clinical decision-making. Issues including negotiating rules for accessing patient records and duplication of recording in paper record systems had not been resolved consistently across services. Conclusions: The findings offer suggestive evidence that a shared electronic health record can support more integrated care. Unresolved issues in implementing the system across all services and settings highlight the governance problems that can arise when systems are developed locally but are then extended across organisational and professional boundaries.

Abstract = {Objectives: We prospectively examined whether socioeconomic status (SES) predicts incident type II diabetes (diabetes), a cardiovascular risk equivalent and burgeoning public health epidemic among women. Methods: Participants include 23,992 women with Hb(A1c) levels <6\% and no CVD or diabetes at baseline followed from February 1993 to March 2007. SES was measured by education and income while diabetes was self-reported. Results: Over 12.3 years of follow-up, 1,262 women developed diabetes. In age and race adjusted models, the relative risk of diabetes decreased with increasing education (<2 years of nursing, 2 to <4 years of nursing, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate: 1.0, 0.7 [95\% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.6-0.8], 0.6 (95\% CI, 0.5-0.7), 0.5 (95\% CI, 0.4-0.6), 0.4 (95\% CI, 0.3-0.5); p(trend)<0.001). Adjustment for traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors attenuated this relationship (education: p(trend)=0.96). Similar associations were observed between income categories and diabetes. Conclusion: Advanced education and increasing income were both inversely associated with incident diabetes even in this relatively well-educated cohort. This relationship was largely explained by behavioral factors, particularly body mass index.},

Abstract = {Background and Aim: Diabetic dyslipidaemia is common in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance and often precedes the onset of T2D. The Taq1B polymorphism in CETP (B1 and B2 alleles) (rs708272) and the G-250A polymorphism in LIPC (rs2070895) are associated with changes in enzyme activity and lipid concentrations. Our aim was to assess the effects of both polymorphisms on the risk of T2D. Methods and Results: In a case-control study from the population-based Telde cohort, both polymorphisms were analysed by PCR-based methods. Subjects were classified, according to an oral glucose tolerance test, into diabetic (N = 115) and pre-diabetic (N = 116); 226 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, matched for age and gender, were included as controls. Chi-square (comparison between groups) and logistic regression (identification of independent effects) were used for analysis. The B1B1 Taq1B CETP genotype frequency increased with worsening glucose metabolism (42.5\%, 46.1\% and 54.3\% in control, IGR and diabetic group; p = 0.042). This polymorphism was independently associated with an increased risk of diabetes (OR: 1.828; IC 95\%: 1.12-2.99; p = 0.016), even after adjusting by confounding variables, whereas the LIPC polymorphism was not. Regarding the interaction between both polymorphisms, in the B1B1 genotype carriers, the absence of the minor (A) allele of the LIPC polymorphism increased the risk of having diabetes. Conclusion: The presence of the B1B1 Taq1B CETP genotype contributes to the presence of diabetes, independently of age, sex, BMI and waist. However, among carriers of B1B1, the presence of GG genotype of the -250 LIPC polymorphism increases this risk further.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested a bacterial role in the development of autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over 30 billion nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples, 144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls, respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions, motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls. These data suggest that a consortium of lactate-and butyrate-producing bacteria in a healthy gut induce a sufficient amount of mucin synthesis to maintain gut integrity. In contrast, non-butyrate-producing lactate-utilizing bacteria prevent optimal mucin synthesis, as identified in autoimmune subjects.},

Abstract = {Background: The associations of glycemic load (GL) and glycemic index (GI) with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are not well-established, particularly in men, and may be modified by gender. Objective: To assess whether high dietary GL and GI increase the risk of CVD in men and women. Methods: A large prospective cohort study (EPIC-MORGEN) was conducted within the general Dutch population among 8,855 men and 10,753 women, aged 21-64 years at baseline (1993-1997) and free of diabetes and CVD. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and GI and GL were calculated using Foster-Powell's international table of GI. Information on morbidity and mortality was obtained through linkage with national registries. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, while adjusting for age, CVD risk factors, and dietary factors. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.9 years, 581 CHD cases and 120 stroke cases occurred among men, and 300 CHD cases and 109 stroke cases occurred among women. In men, GL was associated with an increased CHD risk (adjusted HR per SD increase, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.35]), while no significant association was found in women (1.09 [0.89-1.33]). GI was not associated with CHD risk in both genders, while it was associated with increased stroke risk in men (1.27 [1.02-1.58]) but not in women (0.96 [0.75-1.22]). Similarly, total carbohydrate intake and starch intake were associated with a higher CHD risk in men (1.23 [1.04-1.46]; and 1.24 [1.07-1.45]), but not in women. Conclusion: Among men, high GL and GI, and high carbohydrate and starch intake, were associated with increased risk of CVD.},

Abstract = {Background: A simple diabetes risk tool that does not require laboratory tests would be beneficial in screening individuals at higher risk. Few studies have evaluated the ability of these tools to identify new cases of pre-diabetes. This study aimed to assess the ability of the American Diabetes Association Risk Tool (ADART) to predict the 3-year incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in Taiwanese. Methods: This was a 3-year prospective study of 1021 residents with normoglycemia at baseline, gathered from a random sample of residents aged 40-88 years in a metropolitan city in Taiwan. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of three models were compared: ADART only, ADART plus lifestyle behaviors at baseline, and ADART plus lifestyle behaviors and biomarkers at baseline. The performance of ADART was compared with that of 16 tools that had been reported in the literature. Results: The AUCs and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.60 (0.54-0.66) for men and 0.72 (0.66-0.77) for women in model 1; 0.62 (0.56-0.68) for men and 0.74 (0.68-0.80) for women in model 2; and 0.64 (0.58-0.71) for men and 0.75 (0.69-0.80) for women in model 3. The AUCs of these three models were all above 0.7 in women, but not in men. No significant difference in either women or men (p = 0.268 and 0.156, respectively) was observed in the AUC of these three models. Compared to 16 tools published in the literature, ADART had the second largest AUC in both men and women. Conclusions: ADART is a good screening tool for predicting the three-year incidence of pre-diabetes and diabetes in females of a Taiwanese population. The performance of ADART in men was similar to the results with other tools published in the literature. Its performance was one of the best among the tools reported in the literature.},

Abstract = {Background: Performance indicators assessing quality of diabetes care often look at single processes, e. g. whether an HbA1c test was conducted. Adequate care, however, consists of consecutive processes which should be taken in time (clinical pathways). We assessed quality of diabetes care by looking at single processes versus clinical pathways. In addition, we evaluated the impact of time period definitions on this quality assessment. Methodology: We conducted a cohort study in 2007-2008 using the GIANTT (Groningen Initiative to Analyse type 2 diabetes Treatment) database. Proportions of patients adequately managed for HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and albumin/creatinin ratio (ACR) were calculated for the pathway of (1) risk factor level testing, (2) treatment intensification when indicated, (3) response to treatment evaluation. Strict and wide time periods for each step were defined. Proportions of patients adequately managed regarding the overall pathway and single steps, using strict or wide time periods were compared using odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals. Findings: Of 11176 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 9439 with complete follow-up were included. The majority received annual examination of HbA1c (86\%) and SBP (86\%), whereas this was 67\% for LDL-C and 49\% for ACR. Adequate management regarding the three-step pathway was observed in 73\%, 53\%, 46\%, 41\% of patients for HbA1c, SBP, LDL-C, and ACR respectively. Quality scores reduced significantly due to the second step (OR 0.43, 0.18, 0.44, 0.74), but were not much further reduced by the third step. Timely treatment evaluation occurred in 88\% for HbA1c, 87\% for SBP, 83\% for LDL-C, and 76\% for ACR. The overall score was not significantly changed by using strict time windows. Conclusion: Quality estimates of glycemic, blood pressure and cholesterol management are substantially reduced when looking at clinical pathways as compared to estimates based on commonly used simple process measures.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aims of this paper were to study the reporting rate and completeness of data reported from primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Sweden to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), with a special attention on the relation between these measures and the reporting system used by the PHCCs. Method: A national survey conducted in Swedish primary healthcare covering the year 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 523 PHCCs. Data on 87,099 adult diabetic patients attending these PHCCs and reported to the NDR were obtained from the register. In Sweden, participation in the NDR is voluntary. The data were reported through the Internet, either online using a web-based system or by direct transmission. The main outcome measures were reporting rate and completeness of reported data. Results: Of the 523 PHCCs, almost two-thirds had reported <75\% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. The lowest reporting rate was found among the largest PHCCs, while the highest was found among small PHCCs (p < 0.001). Reasons given for not reporting data to the NDR were lack of time and lack of personnel resources. Altogether, 73.1\% of the PHCCs reported data to the NDR online using a web-based system, 20.5\% used direct transmission and 6.3\% used both systems. The PHCCs that reported data through direct transmission systems reported almost 70\% of their diabetic patients to the NDR, while PHCCs using web-based systems reported 54\% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. Adjusted for other factors, using direct transmission increased the reporting rate by 13.0 percentage points. However, the web-based system contributed to a higher completeness of data than the direct transmission system. Conclusions: A direct transmission system facilitates a high reporting rate to the register at the expense of lower completeness of the reported data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Background: Diabetes and TB are associated, and diabetes is increasingly common in low-income countries where tuberculosis (TB) is highly endemic. However, the role of diabetes for TB has not been assessed in populations where HIV is prevalent. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in an urban population in Tanzania among culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients and non-TB neighbourhood controls. Participants were tested for diabetes according to WHO guidelines and serum concentrations of acute phase reactants were measured. The association between diabetes and TB, and the role of HIV as an effect modifier, were examined using logistic regression. Since blood glucose levels increase during the acute phase response, we adjusted for elevated serum acute phase reactants. Results: Among 803 cases and 350 controls the mean (SD) age was 34.8 (11.9) and 33.8 (12.0) years, and the prevalence of diabetes was 16.7\% (95\% CI: 14.2; 19.4) and 9.4\% (6.6; 13.0), respectively. Diabetes was associated with TB (OR 2.2, 95\% CI: 1.5; 3.4, p < 0.001). However, the association depended on HIV status (interaction, p = 0.01) due to a stronger association among HIV uninfected (OR 4.2, 95\% CI: 1.5; 11.6, p = 0.01) compared to HIV infected (OR 0.1, 95\% CI: 0.01; 1.8, p = 0.13) after adjusting for age, sex, demographic factors and elevated serum acute phase reactants. Conclusion: Diabetes is a risk factor for TB in HIV uninfected, whereas the association in HIV infected patients needs further study. The increasing diabetes prevalence may be a threat to TB control.},

Abstract = {Background: HbA1c has been the gold standard for glycaemic control follow-up for decades. In 2009, a level of 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol) was proposed as diagnostic for diabetes. We test this cut-off in our community. Methods: Participants (946) from a community-based study were screened for diabetes using either a fasting blood glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (OFTT). The HbA1c cut-off of 6.5\% was tested for each group. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for both groups was generated to establish an optimal cut-off. Results: Our study included 224 (23.7\%) males and 722 (76.3\%) females. Using fasting blood glucose alone, 117 (14\%) were diagnosed with diabetes -250\% had an HbA1c value of >= 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol). Using an OGTT, 147 (18\%) were diagnosed with diabetes -246\% had an HbA1c value of >= 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol). ROC curves found a level of 6.1\% (43 mmol/mol) to be optimal in both groups (AUC 0.85 and 0.82 respectively). The sensitivities were 80\% and 75\% and the specificities 77\% and 78\% respectively. Conclusions: A cut off of 6.5\% (48 mmol/mol) is a good diagnostic tool with its high specificity; however the low sensitivity limits its use. We found a level of 6.1\% (43 mmol/mol) to be optimal. This emphasizes the need for evidenced based values to be established in various population groups.},

Abstract = {Background: Patients suffering from diabetes show defective bacterial clearance. This study investigates the effects of elevated plasma glucose levels during diabetes on leukocyte recruitment and function in established models of inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Diabetes was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by intravenous alloxan (causing severe hyperglycemia), or by high fat diet (moderate hyperglycemia). Leukocyte recruitment was studied in anaesthetized mice using intravital microscopy of exposed cremaster muscles, where numbers of rolling, adherent and emigrated leukocytes were quantified before and during exposure to the inflammatory chemokine MIP-2 (0.5 nM). During basal conditions, prior to addition of chemokine, the adherent and emigrated leukocytes were increased in both alloxan-(62 +/- 18\% and 85 +/- 21\%, respectively) and high fat diet-induced (77 +/- 25\% and 86 +/- 17\%, respectively) diabetes compared to control mice. MIP-2 induced leukocyte emigration in all groups, albeit significantly more cells emigrated in alloxan-treated mice (15.3 +/- 1.0) compared to control (8.0 +/- 1.1) mice. Bacterial clearance was followed for 10 days after subcutaneous injection of bioluminescent S. aureus using non-invasive IVIS imaging, and the inflammatory response was assessed by Myeloperoxidase-ELISA and confocal imaging. The phagocytic ability of leukocytes was assessed using LPS-coated fluorescent beads and flow cytometry. Despite efficient leukocyte recruitment, alloxan-treated mice demonstrated an impaired ability to clear bacterial infection, which we found correlated to a 50\% decreased phagocytic ability of leukocytes in diabetic mice. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that reduced ability to clear bacterial infections observed during experimentally induced diabetes is not due to reduced leukocyte recruitment since sustained hyperglycemia results in increased levels of adherent and emigrated leukocytes in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Instead, decreased phagocytic ability observed for leukocytes isolated from diabetic mice might account for the impaired bacterial clearance.},

Abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified more than 30 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Caucasians. However, genomic understanding of T2D in Asians, especially Han Chinese, is still limited. Methods and Principal Findings: A two-stage GWAS was performed in Han Chinese from Mainland China. The discovery stage included 793 T2D cases and 806 healthy controls genotyped using Illumina Human 660- and 610-Quad BeadChips; and the replication stage included two independent case-control populations (a total of 4445 T2D cases and 4458 controls) genotyped using TaqMan assay. We validated the associations of KCNQ1 (rs163182, p = 2.085 x 10(-17), OR 1.28) and C2CD4A/B (rs1370176, p = 3.677 x 10(-4), OR 1.124; rs1436953, p = 7.753 x 10(-6), OR 1.141; rs7172432, p = 4.001 x 10(-5), OR 1.134) in Han Chinese. Conclusions and Significance: Our study represents the first GWAS of T2D with both discovery and replication sample sets recruited from Han Chinese men and women residing in Mainland China. We confirmed the associations of KCNQ1 and C2CD4A/B with T2D, with the latter for the first time being examined in Han Chinese. Arguably, eight more independent loci were replicated in our GWAS.},

Abstract = {The medicinal use and commercialisation of the plants Aloe ferox and Aloe greatheadii are primarily based on research done on Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens. Consequently, in this study we investigated the possible antidiabetic effects of ethanol extracts of A. ferox and A. greatheadii var. davyana leaf gel in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes rat model. Fifty male Wistar rats, weighing 200 g 250 g, were randomly divided into five groups of n =10: normal control rats, diabetic control rats, diabetic rats receiving A. ferox leaf gel extract (300 mg/kg), diabetic rats receiving A. greatheadii leaf gel extract (300 mg/kg), and diabetic rats receiving glibenclamide (600 mu g/kg). Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (40 mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed 5 weeks after injection, following a 12-hour fast, and blood and tissue samples were collected. Compared to the normal control group, STZ significantly increased relative liver and kidney weights, end-point plasma glucose, fructosamine, oxidative stress, liver enzymes, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and TC: high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) values and reduced serum insulin levels. Treatment with A. greatheadii moderately increased serum insulin and HDL-C levels and moderately reduced end-point plasma glucose and liver alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and significantly decreased TC:HDL-C ratios. A. ferox supplementation similarly resulted in moderately increased serum insulin, accompanied by slight corrections in ALP and HDL-C, without any change to end-point plasma glucose values. A. greatheadii and, to a lesser extent, A. ferox, resulted in a clinically relevant improved diabetic state (indicated by moderate to high effect sizes), suggesting that these Aloe species may show promise for treating diabetes.},

The structure of this automatic system based on LDA-MWSVM for the diagnosis of diabetes is composed of three stages: The feature extraction and feature reduction stage by using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method and the classification stage by using Morlet Wavelet Support Vector Machine (MWSVM) classifier stage. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to separate features variables between healthy and patient (diabetes) data in the first stage. The healthy and patient (diabetes) features obtained in the first stage are given to inputs of the MWSVM classifier in the second stage. Finally, in the third stage, the correct diagnosis performance of this automatic system based on LDA-MWSVM for the diagnosis of diabetes is calculated by using sensitivity and specificity analysis, classification accuracy, and confusion matrix, respectively. The classification accuracy of this system was obtained at about 89.74\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Preclinical and observational studies raise the concern about the safety of insulin glargine in terms of cancer initiation and promotion. This study is designed to examine cancer incidence associated with use of insulin glargine vs. intermediate/long-acting human insulin (HI). Methodology: A retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database was conducted to identify adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without a history of cancer who initiated insulin glargine (n = 10,190) or intermediate/long-acting HI (n = 49,253) during 2004-2007. Exclusive users were followed from the date of insulin initiation to the earliest of cancer diagnosis, death, disenrollment, or December 31 2007. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) with Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline propensity score. Findings: The incidence rate of all cancer per 1,000 person-years was 13.8 for insulin glargine initiators (179 cases) and 16.0 for intermediate/long-acting HI initiators (1,445 cases) during an average follow-up of 2 years. No significant difference in overall cancer risk between insulin glargine initiators and HI initiators was found. For men, however, the adjusted hazard ratio of insulin glargine use as compared with intermediate/long-acting HI was 2.15 (95\% CI 1.01-4.59) for pancreatic cancer, and 2.42 (95\% CI 1.50-8.40) for prostate cancer. The increased risk was not observed among women. Conclusions: Insulin glargine use did not increase the risk of overall cancer incidence as compared with HI. The positive associations with pancreatic and prostate cancer need further evaluation and validation.},

Abstract = {In this investigation, we have carried out an autosomal genome-wide linkage analysis to map genes associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and five quantitative traits of blood lipids including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in a unique family-based cohort from the Sikh Diabetes Study (SDS). A total of 870 individuals (526 male/344 female) from 321 families were successfully genotyped using 398 polymorphic microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 9.26 cM on the autosomes. Results of non-parametric multipoint linkage analysis using Sall statistics (implemented in Merlin) did not reveal any chromosomal region to be significantly associated with T2D in this Sikh cohort. However, linkage analysis for lipid traits using QTL-ALL analysis revealed promising linkage signals with p <= 0.005 for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol at chromosomes 5p15, 9q21, 10p11, 10q21, and 22q13. The most significant signal (p = 0.0011) occurred at 10q21.2 for HDL cholesterol. We also observed linkage signals for total cholesterol at 22q13.32 (p = 0.0016) and 5p15.33 (p = 0.0031) and for LDL cholesterol at 10p11.23 (p = 0.0045). Interestingly, some of linkage regions identified in this Sikh population coincide with plausible candidate genes reported in recent genome-wide association and meta-analysis studies for lipid traits. Our study provides the first evidence of linkage for loci associated with quantitative lipid traits at four chromosomal regions in this Asian Indian population from Punjab. More detailed examination of these regions with more informative genotyping, sequencing, and functional studies should lead to rapid detection of novel targets of therapeutic importance.},

Abstract = {Background: This study compares inflammation-related biomarkers with established cardiometabolic risk factors in the prediction of incident type 2 diabetes and incident coronary events in a prospective case-cohort study within the population-based MONICA/KORA Augsburg cohort. Methods and Findings: Analyses for type 2 diabetes are based on 436 individuals with and 1410 individuals without incident diabetes. Analyses for coronary events are based on 314 individuals with and 1659 individuals without incident coronary events. Mean follow-up times were almost 11 years. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), changes in Akaike's information criterion (Delta AIC), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI) were calculated for different models. A basic model consisting of age, sex and survey predicted type 2 diabetes with an AUC of 0.690. Addition of 13 inflammation-related biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, IL-18, MIF, MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, IP-10/CXCL10, adiponectin, leptin, RANTES/CCL5, TGF-beta 1, sE-selectin, sICAM-1; all measured in nonfasting serum) increased the AUC to 0.801, whereas addition of cardiometabolic risk factors (BMI, systolic blood pressure, ratio total/HDL-cholesterol, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, parental diabetes) increased the AUC to 0.803 (Delta AUC [95\% CI] 0.111 [0.092-0.149] and 0.113 [0.093-0.149], respectively, compared to the basic model). The combination of all inflammation-related biomarkers and cardiometabolic risk factors yielded a further increase in AUC to 0.847 (Delta AUC [95\% CI] 0.044 [0.028-0.066] compared to the cardiometabolic risk model). Corresponding AUCs for incident coronary events were 0.807, 0.825 (Delta AUC [95\% CI] 0.018 [0.013-0.038] compared to the basic model), 0.845 (Delta AUC [95\% CI] 0.038 [0.028-0.059] compared to the basic model) and 0.851 (Delta AUC [95\% CI] 0.006 [0.003-0.021] compared to the cardiometabolic risk model), respectively. Conclusions: Inclusion of multiple inflammation-related biomarkers into a basic model and into a model including cardiometabolic risk factors significantly improved the prediction of type 2 diabetes and coronary events, although the improvement was less pronounced for the latter endpoint.},

Abstract = {Background: EGb761, a standardized Ginkgo biloba extract, has antioxidant and antiplatelet aggregation and thus might protect against atherosclerosis. However, molecular and functional properties of EGb761 and its major subcomponents have not been well characterized. We investigated the effect of EGb761 and its major subcomponents (bilobalide, kaemferol, and quercetin) on preventing atherosclerosis in vitro, and in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. Methods and Results: EGb761 (100 and 200 mg/kg) or normal saline (control) were administered to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, an obese insulin-resistant rat model, for 6 weeks (from 3 weeks before to 3 weeks after carotid artery injury). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate cell proliferation and apoptosis in the injured arteries. Cell migration, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation, monocyte adhesion, and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels were explored in vitro. Treatment with EGb761 dose-dependently reduced intima-media ratio, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and induced greater apoptosis than the controls. Proliferation and migration of VSMCs in vitro were also decreased by the treatment of EGb761. Glucose homeostasis and circulating adiponectin levels were improved, and plasma hsCRP concentrations were decreased in the treatment groups. Caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation increased while monocyte adhesion and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 levels decreased significantly. Among subcomponents of EGb761, kaemferol and quercetin reduced VSMC migration and increased caspase activity. Conclusions: EGb761 has a protective role in the development of atherosclerosis and is a potential therapeutic agent for preventing atherosclerosis.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is a chronic and complex endocrine disease with metabolic disorders caused by the imbalance between secreted and needed insulin levels. In the present study, all probabilities were examined considering ten (10) indications (2(10)=1024 different cases) of diabetes using medical expert system (MES), and accordingly, a truth table was established. This table was simplified by the simplification method of logic functions. 15 main rules were obtained using minimization method for Boolean Functions (BFs). These rules established rules base of ES. Subsequently, the parameters of 768 patients were compared with this ES. Accuracy rate of the estimations of MES, created as a result these comparisons, was determined as 97.13\% in diabetes patients, 97\% in non-diabetes patients, 96.5\% in Type 1 patients, 98.26\% in Type 2 patients and 97.44\% in pregnant patients.

Abstract = {During the progression of the clinical onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), high-risk individuals exhibit multiple islet autoantibodies and high-avidity T cells which progressively destroy beta cells causing overt T1D. In particular, novel autoantibodies, such as those against IA-2 epitopes (aa1-577), had a predictive rate of 100\% in a 10-year follow up (rapid progressors), unlike conventional autoantibodies that required 15 years of follow up for a 74\% predictive rate (slow progressors). The discrepancy between these two groups is thought to be associated with T-cell avidity, including CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells. For this purpose, we build a series of mathematical models incorporating first one clone then multiple clones of islet-specific and pathogenic CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells, together with B lymphocytes, to investigate the interaction of T-cell avidity with autoantibodies in predicting disease onset. These models are instrumental in examining several experimental observations associated with T-cell avidity, including the phenomenon of avidity maturation (increased average T-cell avidity over time), based on intra-and cross-clonal competition between T cells in high-risk human subjects. The model shows that the level and persistence of autoantibodies depends not only on the avidity of T cells, but also on the killing efficacy of these cells. Quantification and modeling of autoreactive T-cell avidities can thus determine the level of risk associated with each type of autoantibodies and the timing of T1D disease onset in individuals that have been tested positive for these autoantibodies. Such studies may lead to early diagnosis of the disease in high-risk individuals and thus potentially serve as a means of staging patients for clinical trials of preventive or interventional therapies far before disease onset.},

Abstract = {Tight glycemic control (TGC) has emerged as a major research focus in critical care due to its potential to simultaneously reduce both mortality and costs. However, repeating initial successful TGC trials that reduced mortality and other outcomes has proven difficult with more failures than successes. Hence, there has been growing debate over the necessity of TGC, its goals, the risk of severe hypoglycemia, and target cohorts. This paper provides a review of TGC via new analyses of data from several clinical trials, including SPRINT, Glucontrol and a recent NICU study. It thus provides both a review of the problem and major background factors driving it, as well as a novel model-based analysis designed to examine these dynamics from a new perspective. Using these clinical results and analysis, the goal is to develop new insights that shed greater light on the leading factors that make TGC difficult and inconsistent, as well as the requirements they thus impose on the design and implementation of TGC protocols. A model-based analysis of insulin sensitivity using data from three different critical care units, comprising over 75,000 h of clinical data, is used to analyse variability in metabolic dynamics using a clinically validated model-based insulin sensitivity metric (S(I)). Variation in S(I) provides a new interpretation and explanation for the variable results seen (across cohorts and studies) in applying TGC. In particular, significant intra- and inter-patient variability in insulin resistance (1/S(I)) is seen be a major confounder that makes TGC difficult over diverse cohorts, yielding variable results over many published studies and protocols. Further factors that exacerbate this variability in glycemic outcome are found to include measurement frequency and whether a protocol is blind to carbohydrate administration.

Abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disorder resulting from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world. In this study a tissue engineering approach was compared with a macroencapsulation approach to reverse type 1 diabetes in a rat model. using mouse pancreatic progenitor cell (PPC)-derived islet-like clusters and mouse islets. For the tissue engineering approach the cells were cultured on gelatin scaffolds cross-linked with EDC in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in vitro (GPE scaffolds), while for the macroencapsulation approach the cells were encapsulated in polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone semi-Interpenetrating networks. In the combination approach the cells cultured on GPE scaffolds were further encapsulated in a polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone capsule. Real time PCR studies and the glucose challenge assay have shown that cells on GPE scaffolds could express and secrete insulin and glucagon in vitro. However, under in vivo conditions the animals treated by the tissue engineering approach died within 15-20 days and showed no reversal of their diabetes, due to infiltration of immune cells such as CD4 and CD8 cells and macrophages. In the macroencapsulation approach the animals showed euglycemia within 25 days, which was maintained for further 20 days, but after that the animals died. Interestingly, in the combination approach the animals showed reversal of hyperglycemia, and remained euglycemic for up to 3 months. The time needed to achieve initial euglycemia was different with different cell types, i e. the combination approach with mouse Islets achieved euglycemia within 15 days, whereas with PPC-derived islet-like clusters euglycemia was achieved within 25 days This study confirmed that a combination of tissue engineering and macroencapsulation with mouse islets could reverse diabetes and maintain euglycemia in an experimental diabetes rat model for 90 days.

Abstract = {Objectives: To describe the use and evaluate the effectiveness of different lipid lowering therapies in unselected patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in clinical practice. Design: Observational population-based study using the personal identification number to link information from the National Diabetes Register, the Prescribed Drug Register and the Patient register in Sweden. All patients in the NDR aged 18-75 years with diabetes more than one year were eligible, but only patients starting any lipid lowering treatment with at least three prescriptions 1 July 2006-30 June 2007 were included (n = 37182). The mean blood lipid levels in 2008 and reductions in LDL cholesterol were examined. Results: Blood lipid levels were similar in patients treated with simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, showing similar lipid lowering effect as currently used. Users of pravastatin, fluvastatin, ezetimib and fibrate more seldom reach treatment goals. Moderate daily doses of the statins were used, with 76\% of simvastatin users taking 20 mg or less, 48\% of atorvastatin users taking 10 mg, 55\% of pravastatin users taking 20 mg, and 76\% of rosuvastatin users taking 5 or 10 mg. Conclusions: This observational study shows that the LDL-C levels in patients taking simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are very similar as currently used, as well as their LDL-C lowering abilities. There is potential to intensify lipid lowering treatment to reduce the remaining high residual risk and achieve better fulfilment of treatment goals, since the commonly used doses are only low to moderate.},

Abstract = {Background: The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a well-studied non-obese spontaneous type 2 diabetes (T2D) animal model characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the pancreatic beta cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs involved in many fundamental biological processes. We aim to identify miRNAs that are differentially-expressed in the pancreatic islets of the GK rats and investigate both their short-and long term glucose-dependence during glucose-stimulatory conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Global profiling of 348 miRNAs in the islets of GK rats and Wistar controls (females, 60 days, N = 6 for both sets) using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based microarrays allowed for the clear separation of the two groups. Significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified 30 differentially-expressed miRNAs, 24 of which are predominantly upregulated in the GK rat islets. Monitoring of qPCR-validated miRNAs during GSIS experiments on isolated islets showed disparate expression trajectories between GK and controls indicating distinct short-and long-term glucose dependence. We specifically found expression of rno-miR-130a, rno-miR-132, rno-miR-212 and rno-miR-335 to be regulated by hyperglycaemia. The putative targets of upregulated miRNAs in the GK, filtered with glucose-regulated mRNAs, were found to be enriched for insulin-secretion genes known to be downregulated in T2D patients. Finally, the binding of rno-miR-335 to a fragment of the 3'UTR of one of known down-regulated exocytotic genes in GK islets, Stxbp1 was shown by luciferase assay. Conclusions/Significance: The perturbed miRNA network found in the GK rat islets is indicative of a system-wide impairment in the regulation of genes important for the normal functions of pancreatic islets, particularly in processes involving insulin secretion during glucose stimulatory conditions. Our findings suggest that the reduced insulin secretion observed in the GK rat may be partly due to upregulated miRNA expression leading to decreased production of key proteins of the insulin exocytotic machinery.},

Abstract = {Platensimycin (PTM) is a recently discovered broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by Streptomyces platensis. It acts by selectively inhibiting the elongation-condensing enzyme FabF of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in bacteria. We report here that PTM is also a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mammalian fatty acid synthase. In contrast to two agents, C75 and cerulenin, that are widely used as inhibitors of mammalian fatty acid synthase, platensimycin specifically inhibits fatty acid synthesis but not sterol synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes. PTM preferentially concentrates in liver when administered orally to mice and potently inhibits hepatic de novo lipogenesis, reduces fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose oxidation. Chronic administration of platensimycin led to a net reduction in liver triglyceride levels and improved insulin sensitivity in db/+ mice fed a high-fructose diet. PTM also reduced ambient glucose levels in db/db mice. These results provide pharmacological proof of concept of inhibiting fatty acid synthase for the treatment of diabetes and related metabolic disorders in animal models.},

Abstract = {Background: A pilot study was performed in order to investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on whole blood gene expression profiles in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Whole blood from eleven obese subjects with type 2 diabetes was collected in PAXgene tubes prior to and 6-12 months after bariatric surgery. Total RNA was isolated, amplified, labeled and hybridized to Illumina gene expression microarrays. Clinical and expression data were analyzed using a paired t-test, and correlations between changes in clinical trait and transcript levels were calculated. Pathways were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DAVID gene ontology software. Overall, bariatric surgery resulted in significant reduction of body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and normalization of glycosylated hemoglobin levels. The expression levels of 204 transcripts, representing 200 unique genes, were significantly altered after bariatric surgery. Among the significantly regulated genes were GGT1, CAMP, DEFA1, LCN2, TP53, PDSS1, OLR1, CNTNAP5, DHCR24, HHAT and SARDH, which have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism, obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. Selected findings were replicated by quantitative real-time-PCR. The changes in expression of seven transcripts, WDR35, FLF45244, DHCR24, TIGD7, TOPBP1, TSHZ1, and FAM8A1 were strongly correlated with the changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin content. The top pathways associated with gene expression changes after bariatric surgery was lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and gene expression. Two antimicrobial peptides were among the transcripts with the largest changes in gene expression after bariatric surgery. Conclusions/Significance: Data from this pilot study suggest that whole blood expression levels of specific transcripts may be useful as biomarkers associated with susceptibility for type 2 diabetes and/or therapeutic response.},

Abstract = {The rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are rising to epidemic proportions in the US and worldwide. While current T2D medications are efficacious, significant side effects have limited their use and availability. Our laboratory has discovered that abscisic acid (ABA) exerts anti-diabetic effects, in part, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). However, since ABA does not bind to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR gamma, the mechanism of activation of PPAR gamma by ABA remains unknown. Lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) was predicted to be a novel target for the binding and signaling of ABA in human granulocytes and rat insulinoma cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether LANCL2 is a molecular target of ABA and other PPAR gamma agonists. To this end we performed homology modeling to construct a three-dimensional structure of LANCL2 using the crystal structure of LANCL1 as a template. Our molecular docking studies predicted that ABA and other PPAR gamma agonists (e.g., rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) share a binding site on the surface of LANCL2. The identification of a binding site for PPAR gamma agonists will facilitate the high-throughput virtual screening of large compound libraries and may shed new light on alternative mechanisms of PPAR gamma activation.},

Abstract = {How to design a clinical test aimed at identifying in the safest, most precise and quickest way the subject-specific parameters of a detailed model of glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes is the topic of this article. Recently, standard techniques of model-based design of experiments (MBDoE) for parameter identification have been proposed to design clinical tests for the identification of the model parameters for a single type 1 diabetic individual. However, standard MBDoE is affected by some limitations. In particular, the existence of a structural mismatch between the responses of the subject and that of the model to be identified, together with initial uncertainty in the model parameters may lead to design clinical tests that are sub-optimal (scarcely informative) or even unsafe (the actual response of the subject might be hypoglycaemic or strongly hyperglycaemic). The integrated use of two advanced MBDoE techniques (online model-based redesign of experiments and backoff-based MBDoE) is proposed in this article as a way to effectively tackle the above issue. Online model-based experiment redesign is utilised to exploit the information embedded in the experimental data as soon as the data become available, and to adjust the clinical test accordingly whilst the test is running. Backoff-based MBDoE explicitly accounts for model parameter uncertainty, and allows one to plan a test that is both optimally informative and safe by design. The effectiveness and features of the proposed approach are assessed and critically discussed via a simulated case study based on state-of-the-art detailed models of glucose homeostasis. It is shown that the proposed approach based on advanced MBDoE techniques allows defining safe, informative and subject-tailored clinical tests for model identification, with limited experimental effort.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to test the effects of providing Web-based diabetes education to individuals with type 2 diabetes on the A(1c) level and health check attendance. The study participants comprised 122 individuals with type 2 diabetes, who had access to the Internet, had completed their basic diabetes education, and had similar basic situational factors. Using a randomization method, these participants were chosen from the patients being monitored by the diabetes nurses. The experimental group (n = 61) was monitored via the Web. From measurements recorded in the sixth month of monitoring, we found that A1c levels of the individuals with diabetes who were monitored through the Web decreased (t = 6.63; P G.05), and the rate of attending health check visits increased (z= 5.97; P <.05), while no difference was detected in the control group (t = -0.63; P =.534; z = -0.80; P =.426). To maintain glycemic control, Web use could be adopted as a complementary tool for monitoring individuals with diabetes.},

Abstract = {A porous large poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MS) adsorbed with palmityl-acylated exendin-4 (Ex4-C(16)) was devised as an inhalation delivery system. The porous MS was prepared by a single o/w emulsification/solvent evaporation method using extractable Pluronic F68/F127, and its fabrication and formulation conditions were carefully optimized. Results show that the prepared MS was in the appropriate size range for inhalation and contained many surfaces and internal pores meaning low aerodynamic density. Ex4-C(16) was more efficiently adsorbed onto porous PLGA MSs than native exendin-4, and an approximately 5\% loading of Ex4-C(16) onto this porous MS (RG504H) was achieved. This optimized porous MS was found to be efficiently deposited throughout the entire lungs of mice including alveoli region. Furthermore, this porous MS adsorbed with Ex4-C(16) (approx. 100 mu g/mouse) displayed much protracted hypoglycemic efficacy in non-fasted type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Porous PLGA MS with adsorbed Ex4-C(16) showed the dual-advantages of (i) sustained release and acceptable drug-loading due to strong hydrophobic interaction and (ii) longer in vivo pulmonary hypoglycemic duration due to albumin-binding by the palmityl group. We consider that this new prototype of porous PLGA MS has considerable pharmaceutical potential as a type 2 anti-diabetic inhalation treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of decision support systems based on domain knowledge are adopted to diagnose medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. It is widely pointed that the classical ontologies cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and knowledge problems with uncertainty. This paper presents a novel fuzzy expert system for diabetes decision support application. A five-layer fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to describe knowledge with uncertainty. By applying the novel fuzzy ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes ontology (FDO) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. Additionally, a semantic decision support agent (SDSA), including a knowledge construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. The knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and relations based on the structure of the FDO. The instances of the FDO are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. Finally, based on the FDO and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for diabetes-related application. Importantly, the proposed fuzzy expert system can work effectively for diabetes decision support application.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases that have an effect on the life of a large number of people around the world. This chronic disease causes approximately 5\% of all deaths globally each year[1], and is most likely to increase exponentially within the coming few years. Reduction to the effect of such a disease, a close monitoring to patients is essential in order to control its level via increasing patients' awareness. Thus a smart system that is capable of collecting medical readings from patients, analyzing the data, and suggesting the appropriate diagnosis has become a necessity. This work advises a system that is capable of meeting all of the above along with reducing the physical access load on healthcare centers via instructing the system to notify both healthcare provider and patients with the acquired results},

Abstract = {Chronic Disease Management (CDM) is an important area of health care where Health Knowledge Management can provide substantial benefits. A web-based chronic disease management service, called cdmNet, is accumulating detailed data on CDM as it is being rolled out across Australia. This paper presents the application of unsupervised neural networks to cdmNet data to: (1) identify interesting patterns in diabetes data; and (2) assist diabetes related policy-making at different levels. The work is distinct from existing research in: (1) the data; (2) the objectives; and (3) the techniques used. The data represents the diabetes population across the entire primary care sector. The objectives include diabetes related decision and policy making at different levels. The pattern recognition techniques combine a traditional approach to data mining,involving the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), with an extension to include the Growing Self-Organizing Map (GSOM).},

Abstract = {This study presents a metabolic modeling scheme for glucose prediction of diabetic patients that is intended for use in mobile devices. We investigate the ability to model the multivariate, nonlinear and dynamic interactions in glucose metabolism using free-living data acquired from wearable sensors or inserted through suitable mobile applications. The physiological processes related to diabetes are simulated by compartmental models, which quantify the absorption of subcutaneously administered insulin, the absorption of glucose from the gut following a meal, as well as the effects of exercise on plasma glucose and insulin dynamics. In addition, Support Vector machines for Regression are employed to provide individualized predictions of the subcutaneous glucose concentrations. The proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of its predictive ability using real data recorded from two type 1 diabetic patients. Also, the incorporation of the predictive model in an integrated diabetes monitoring and management system is discussed.},

Abstract = {Exploiting the full potential of telemedical systems means using platform based solutions: data are recovered from biomedical sensors, hospital information systems, care-givers, as well as patients themselves, and are processed and redistributed in an either centralized or, more probably, decentralized way. The integration of all these different devices, and interfaces, as well as the automated analysis and representation of all the pieces of information are current key challenges in telemedicine. Mobile phone technology has just begun to offer great opportunities of using this diverse information for guiding, warning, and educating patients, thus increasing their autonomy and adherence to their prescriptions. However, most of these existing mobile solutions are not based on platform systems and therefore represent limited, isolated applications. This article depicts how telemedical systems, based on integrated health data platforms, can maximize prescription adherence in chronic patients through mobile feedback. The application described here has been developed in an EU-funded R\&D project called METABO, dedicated to patients with type 1 or type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.},

Abstract = {New sensors for real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), possibly mounted on the same device, opened new scenarios for Type-1 diabetes treatment. However, possible failures of either CGM or CSII can expose diabetic patients to risks that can be dangerous especially overnight. In this contribution we present a proof-of-concept method, developed in a state-space context and implemented through a Kalman estimator, to detect in real time possible overnight failures of the sensor-pump system by simultaneously using CGM and CSII data. The method is tested on two simulated and one real subject. Results show that the method is able to correctly generate alerts for sensor-pump failures and stimulates further investigation on its development.},

Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is now the most rapidly growing form of diabetes and has become increasingly common among children. This paper presents our work of implementing an individualized real time predictive system for blood glucose in type 2 diabetes in an iPhone application. The developed application, called HealthiManage, provides relevant feedback to patients at each glucose input reading comparing the measured and predicted readings, facilitating improved self-management of the disease. The application incorporates activity recognition via a built-in accelerometer on the iPhone, which monitors any physical activity and adjusts predictions accordingly. Also, a reward component interface was incorporated that is intended to enhance patient compliance and encourage mainly teenagers to take control and improve their blood glucose regulation. The individualized prediction algorithm was tested and verified with real patient data. Different physical activities were also examined and classified for an accurate activity recognition component. The designed application with its predictive model, activity recognition, and other elements provide what we believe to be helpful feedback to monitor and manage type 2 diabetes and improve patient compliance.},

Abstract = {Goal of this study is to model the long-term health care and economic consequences of the new antidiabetic medicine (liraglutide) for the health care system in Bulgaria using the CORE diabetes model. The CORE diabetes model is a disease computer simulation model developed to project long-term health and social outcomes of interventions in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, taking into account diabetes therapies, screening and treatment strategies for microvascular and end-stage complications, and multifactorial interventions. A total of 66 internal and external validation analyses were performed across a range of complications and outcomes simulated by the model. Disease progression probabilities and treatment pathways were based on published sources, and 7 modifiable risk factors of diabetes were used (HbA(1c), SBP, T-Chol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and BMI). The model was based on a series of 16 interdependent Markov sub-models that simulate a progression of disease-related complications. As a result from the modelling the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of diabetes patients increased with liraglutide 1.2 mg by 0.252 (SD 0.129) years. Total costs increased by BGN 7722 resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained which amounted to BGN 30 674. The univaried sensitivity analyses for liraglutide 1.2 mg revealed incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QALY ranging from BGN 23 699 to BGN 156 330, when no discount rate for both future costs and outcomes was applied and change in HbA(1c) on par with comparator was set, respectively. Liraglutide 1.2 mg was shown to be cost effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes if the willingness to pay thresholds was around BGN 30 000 per additional QALY gained.},

The acquired knowledge as scenarios are scored by AHP mechanism and represented in the DIABRA. The validation results show the expert system gives a highly satisfactory performance when compared to human experts. In addition, the computerized system shows additional advantages which can be used as helpful tool to reduce the chance of getting Type 2 diabetes.},

Abstract = {Aim of this work is to review and characterize methods and systems that are used to prevent onset and to slow down the progression of the late complications of diabetes. Two groups of methods and systems that might be used to prevent or to slow down the progression of the late complications of diabetes are characterized in this paper. Each of these two groups serves a different purpose. The first group is composed of the systems that facilitate a maintenance of strict metabolic control in diabetic patients, i.e. the systems which are used for monitoring and treatment of diabetes. The second group contains systems that are aimed at screening/monitoring or treatment of the risk factors or the early signs of the late complications. Obesity increases risk of diabetes and its complications. Thus, body mass monitoring and control systems are examples of the tools that belong to this group. Other examples include the diabetic retinopathy telescreening systems and the systems for monitoring of the diabetic foot syndrome.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the 4 Diabetes Support System (TM) (4DSS) project as a case study in case-based reasoning (CBR) research and development. This project aims to help patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy achieve and maintain good blood glucose control. Over the course of seven years and three clinical research studies, a series of defining cases altered the research and development path. Each of these cases suggested a new, unanticipated research direction or clinical application. New AI technologies, including naive Bayes classification and support vector regression, were incorporated. New medical research into glycemic variability and blood glucose prediction was undertaken. The CBR research paradigm has provided a strong framework for medical research as well as for artificial intelligence (AI) research. This new work has the potential to positively impact the health and wellbeing of patients with diabetes. This paper shares the 4DSS project experience.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct an economic evaluation of liraglutide combined with metformin (MET) and/or sulfonylurea therapy (SU) in comparison with exenatide in combination with MET and/or SU therapy in type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with MET and/or SU. The study was conducted with respect to conditions of the Bulgarian health care system, from the perspective of the health care services payer and included only direct medical costs and benefits. Cost-effectiveness economic analysis was applied to calculate the cost per quality adjusted life year (cost/QALY) and the cost per life year gained (cost/LYG), after modelling the cost of therapy and results from the clinical trial. In this model, the Bulgarian cost data were used and therapeutic practice analysis was performed. Clinical results were based on the LEAD 6 trial, patients demographics and health state utility values were used as default values determined by the CORE diabetes model. Health state utility values for disease and treatment-related outcomes were used to determine quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the base case analysis, the total cost of therapy with liraglutide was higher than that with exenatide, but the complications cost was lower, which could be attributed to better haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control. Life expectancy and QALYs increased with liraglutide (1.8 mg ones per day) by 0.129 (SD 0.175) and 0.151 (SD 0.124) years, respectively. Total costs increased by 4151 Bulgarian Levs (BGN) resulting in an incremental cost per LYG of BGN 32 082 and incremental costs per QALY gained of BGN 27 404. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that liraglutide (1.8 mg) can be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared to exenatide, with 71\% probability of being a cost-effective treatment approach if the willingness to pay threshold is BGN 50 000 (based on QALY). Liraglutide (1.8 mg) has been shown to be cost effective when compared to exenatide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes if the hypothetical willingness to pay threshold is approximately BGN 50 000 per QALY.},

Abstract = {Background: An increase of diabetes prevalence of up to 80\% is predicted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2025 exceeding the worldwide 55\%. Mortality rates of diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes shares several common factors with HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health problems have been efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical record system (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes in SSA could be extremely helpful. Objectives: The aim was to design and validate a conceptual model for an EMRS to improve diabetes management in SSA making use of the HIV and TB experience. Methods: A review of the literature addressed diabetes care and management in SSA as well as existing examples of information and communication technology (ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment conducted in SSA a conceptual model based on the traditionally structured healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a three-layer structure. Application modules were derived and a demonstrator programmed based on an open source EMRS. Then the approach was validated by SSA experts. Results: A conceptual model could be specified and validated which enhances a problem-oriented approach to diabetes management processes. The prototyp EMRS demonstrates options for a patient portal and simulation tools for education of health professional and patients in SSA. Conclusion: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA which follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin America. The local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will, however, depend on training and changes in work behavior.},

Abstract = {Background: In-silico virtual patients and trials offer significant advantages in cost, time and safety for designing effective tight glycemic control (TGC) protocols. However, no such method has fully validated the independence of virtual patients (or resulting clinical trial predictions) from the data used to create them. This study uses matched cohorts from a TGC clinical trial to validate virtual patients and in-silico virtual trial models and methods. Methods: Data from a 211 patient subset of the Glucontrol trial in Liege, Belgium. Glucontrol-A (N = 142) targeted 4.4-6.1 mmol/L and Glucontrol-B (N = 69) targeted 7.8-10.0 mmol/L. Cohorts were matched by APACHE II score, initial BG, age, weight, BMI and sex (p > 0.25). Virtual patients are created by fitting a clinically validated model to clinical data, yielding time varying insulin sensitivity profiles (SI(t)) that drives in-silico patients. Model fit and intra-patient (forward) prediction errors are used to validate individual in-silico virtual patients. Self-validation (tests A protocol on Group-A virtual patients; and B protocol on B virtual patients) and cross-validation (tests A protocol on Group-B virtual patients; and B protocol on A virtual patients) are used in comparison to clinical data to assess ability to predict clinical trial results. Results: Model fit errors were small (<0.25\%) for all patients, indicating model fitness. Median forward prediction errors were: 4.3, 2.8 and 3.5\% for Group-A, Group-B and Overall (A+B), indicating individual virtual patients were accurate representations of real patients. SI and its variability were similar between cohorts indicating they were metabolically similar. Self and cross validation results were within 1-10\% of the clinical data for both Group-A and Group-B. Self-validation indicated clinically insignificant errors due to model and/or clinical compliance. Cross-validation clearly showed that virtual patients enabled by identified patient-specific SI(t) profiles can accurately predict the performance of independent and different TGC protocols. Conclusions: This study fully validates these virtual patients and in silico virtual trial methods, and clearly shows they can accurately simulate, in advance, the clinical results of a TGC protocol, enabling rapid in silico protocol design and optimization. These outcomes provide the first rigorous validation of a virtual in-silico patient and virtual trials methodology.},

Abstract = {Background: Walking and cardiovascular mortality are inversely associated in type 2 diabetes, but few studies have objectively measured associations of walking with individual cardiovascular risk factors. Such information would be useful for ``dosing'' daily steps in clinical practice. This study aimed to quantify decrements in blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) per 1,000 daily step increments. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two hundred and one subjects with type 2 diabetes underwent assessments of step counts (pedometer-measured), blood pressure, A1C and anthropometric parameters. Due to missing data, the final analysis was conducted on 83 women and 102 men, with a mean age of 60 years. Associations of daily steps with blood pressure and A1C were evaluated using sex-specific multivariate linear regression models (adjusted for age, ethnicity, and BMI). Potential sex differences were confirmed in a combined model (women and men) with interaction terms. Mean values for daily steps, blood pressure, A1C and BMI were 5,357 steps/day; 137/80 mm Hg; 7.7\% and 30.4 kg/m(2) respectively. A 1,000 daily step increment among women was associated with a -2.6 (95\% CI: -4.1 to -1.1) mm Hg change in systolic and a -1.4 (95\% CI: -2.2 to -0.6) mm Hg change in diastolic blood pressure. Among men, corresponding changes were -0.7 (95\% CI: -2.1 to 0.7) and -0.6 (95\% CI: -1.4 to 0.3) mm Hg, respectively. Sex differences were confirmed in combined models. Step counts and A1C did not demonstrate clinically important associations. Conclusions/Significance: A 1,000 steps/day increment is associated with important blood pressure decrements among women with type 2 diabetes but the data were inconclusive among men. Targeted ``dose increments'' of 1,000 steps/day in women may lead to measurable blood pressure reductions. This information may be of potential use in the titration or ``dosing'' of daily steps. No associations were found between step count increments and A1C.},

Abstract = {Background: This study assessed whether the number of comorbid conditions unrelated to diabetes was associated with a delay in therapeutic progression of diabetes treatment in Australian veterans. Methodology/Principal Findings: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using data from the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) claims database between July 2000 and June 2008. The study included new users of metformin or sulfonylurea medicines. The outcome was the time to addition or switch to another antidiabetic treatment. The total number of comorbid conditions unrelated to diabetes was identified using the pharmaceutical-based comorbidity index, Rx-Risk-V. Competing risk regression analyses were conducted, with adjustments for a number of covariates that included age, gender, residential status, use of endocrinology service, number of hospitalisation episodes and adherence to diabetes medicines. Overall, 20134 veterans were included in the study. At one year, 23.5\% of patients with diabetes had a second medicine added or had switched to another medicine, with 41.4\% progressing by 4 years. The number of unrelated comorbidities was significantly associated with the time to addition of an antidiabetic medicine or switch to insulin (subhazard ratio [SHR] 0.87 [95\% CI 0.84-0.91], P<0.001). Depression, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease were individually associated with a decreased likelihood of therapeutic progression. Age, residential status, number of hospitalisations and adherence to anti-diabetic medicines delayed therapeutic progression. Conclusions/Significance: Increasing numbers of unrelated conditions decreased the likelihood of therapeutic progression in veterans with diabetes. These results have implications for the development of quality measures, clinical guidelines and the construction of models of care for management of diabetes in elderly people with comorbidities.},

Abstract = {Background: Metabolomics is the rapidly evolving field of the comprehensive measurement of ideally all endogenous metabolites in a biological fluid. However, no single analytic technique covers the entire spectrum of the human metabolome. Here we present results from a multiplatform study, in which we investigate what kind of results can presently be obtained in the field of diabetes research when combining metabolomics data collected on a complementary set of analytical platforms in the framework of an epidemiological study. Methodology/Principal Findings: 40 individuals with self-reported diabetes and 60 controls (male, over 54 years) were randomly selected from the participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study, representing an extensively phenotyped sample of the general German population. Concentrations of over 420 unique small molecules were determined in overnight-fasting blood using three different techniques, covering nuclear magnetic resonance and tandem mass spectrometry. Known biomarkers of diabetes could be replicated by this multiple metabolomic platform approach, including sugar metabolites (1,5-anhydroglucoitol), ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate), and branched chain amino acids. In some cases, diabetes-related medication can be detected (pioglitazone, salicylic acid). Conclusions/Significance: Our study depicts the promising potential of metabolomics in diabetes research by identification of a series of known and also novel, deregulated metabolites that associate with diabetes. Key observations include perturbations of metabolic pathways linked to kidney dysfunction (3-indoxyl sulfate), lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids, free fatty acids), and interaction with the gut microflora (bile acids). Our study suggests that metabolic markers hold the potential to detect diabetes-related complications already under sub-clinical conditions in the general population.},

Abstract = {Objective: Biological evidence suggests that inflammation might induce type 2 diabetes (T2D), and epidemiological studies have shown an association between higher white blood cell count (WBC) and T2D. However, the association has not been systematically investigated. Research Design and Methods: Studies were identified through computer-based and manual searches. Previously unreported studies were sought through correspondence. 20 studies were identified (8,647 T2D cases and 85,040 non-cases). Estimates of the association of WBC with T2D were combined using random effects meta-analysis; sources of heterogeneity as well as presence of publication bias were explored. Results: The combined relative risk (RR) comparing the top to bottom tertile of the WBC count was 1.61 (95\% CI: 1.45; 1.79, p = 1.5*10(-18)). Substantial heterogeneity was present (I(2) = 83\%). For granulocytes the RR was 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.17; 1.64, p = 1.5*10(-4)), for lymphocytes 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.02; 1.56, p = 0.029), and for monocytes 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.68; 1.28, p = 0.67) comparing top to bottom tertile. In cross-sectional studies, RR was 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.49; 2.02, p = 7.7*10(-13)), while in cohort studies it was 1.48 (95\% CI: 1.22; 1.79, p = 7.7*10(-5)). We assessed the impact of confounding in EPIC-Norfolk study and found that the age and sex adjusted HR of 2.19 (95\% CI: 1.74; 2.75) was attenuated to 1.82 (95\% CI: 1.45; 2.29) after further accounting for smoking, T2D family history, physical activity, education, BMI and waist circumference. Conclusions: A raised WBC is associated with higher risk of T2D. The presence of publication bias and failure to control for all potential confounders in all studies means the observed association is likely an overestimate.},

Abstract = {In Background: Insulin-dependent Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disease that destroys beta cells within the pancreatic islets and afflicts over 10 million people worldwide. These patients face life-long risks for blindness, cardiovascular and renal diseases, and complications of insulin treatment. New therapies that protect islets from autoimmune destruction and allow continuing insulin production are needed. Increasing evidence regarding the pathomechanism of T1D indicates that islets are destroyed by the relentless attack by autoreactive immune cells evolving from an aberrant action of the innate, in addition to adaptive, immune system that produces islet-toxic cytokines, chemokines, and other effectors of islet inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that targeting nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors evoked by agonist-stimulated innate and adaptive immunity receptors would protect islets from autoimmune destruction. Principal Findings: Here we show that a first-in-class inhibitor of nuclear import, cSN50 peptide, affords in vivo islet protection following a 2-day course of intense treatment in NOD mice, which resulted in a diabetes-free state for one year without apparent toxicity. This nuclear import inhibitor precipitously reduces the accumulation of islet-destructive autoreactive lymphocytes while enhancing activation-induced cell death of T and B lymphocytes derived from autoimmune diabetes-prone, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that develop T1D. Moreover, in this widely used model of human T1D we noted attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in immune cells. Conclusions: These results indicate that a novel form of immunotherapy that targets nuclear import can arrest inflammation-driven destruction of insulin-producing beta cells at the site of autoimmune attack within pancreatic islets during the progression of T1D.},

To design the controller, model-based predictive control scheme has been applied to a newly developed diabetic patient model. The controller is provided with a feedforward loop to improve meal compensation, a gain-scheduling scheme to account for different BG levels, and an asymmetric cost function to reduce hypoglycemic risk. A simulation environment that has been approved for testing of artificial pancreas control algorithms has been used to test the controller. The simulation results show a good controller performance in fasting conditions and meal disturbance rejection, and robustness against model-patient mismatch and errors in meal estimation.},

Abstract = {A new approach based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is presented for diagnosis of diabetes diseases. The Pima Indians diabetes data set contains records of patients with known diagnosis. The ANFIS classifiers learn how to differentiate a new case in the domain by being given a training set of such records. The ANFIS classifier is used to detect diabetes diseases when eight features defining diabetes indications are used as inputs. The proposed ANFIS model combines neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. The conclusions concerning the impacts of features on the diagnosis of diabetes disease are obtained through analysis of the ANFIS. The performance of the ANFIS model is evaluated in terms of training performances and classification accuracies and the results confirm that the proposed ANFIS model has potential in detecting diabetes diseases.},

Abstract = {Objective: The minor T-allele of rs780094 in the glucokinase regulator gene (GCKR) associates with a number of metabolic traits including higher triglyceride levels and improved glycemic regulation in study populations of mostly European ancestry. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we sought to replicate these findings, examine them in a large population-based sample of African American study participants, and to investigate independent associations with other metabolic traits in order to determine if variation in GKCR contributes to their observed clustering. In addition, we examined the association of rs780094 with incident diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke over up mean follow-up times of 8, 15, and 15 years, respectively. Research Design and Methods: Race-stratified analyses were conducted among 10,929 white and 3,960 black participants aged 45-64 at baseline assuming an additive genetic model and using linear and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Previous findings replicated among white participants in multivariable adjusted models: the T-allele of rs780094 was associated with lower fasting glucose (p = 10(-7)) and insulin levels (p = 10(-6)), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 10(-9)), less prevalent diabetes (p = 10(-6)), and higher CRP (p = 10(-8)), 2-h postprandial glucose (OGTT, p = 10(-6)), and triglyceride levels (p = 10(-31)). Moreover, the T-allele was independently associated with higher HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.022), metabolic syndrome prevalence (p = 0.043), and lower beta-cell function measured as HOMA-B (p = 0.011). Among black participants, the T-allele was associated only with higher triglyceride levels (p = 0.004) and lower insulin levels (p = 0.002) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.013). Prospectively, the T-allele was associated with reduced incidence of diabetes (p = 10(-4)) among white participants, but not with incidence of CHD or stroke. Conclusions: Our findings indicate rs780094 has independent associations with multiple metabolic traits as well as incident diabetes, but not incident CHD or stroke. The magnitude of association between the SNP and most traits was of lower magnitude among African American compared to white participants.},

Abstract = {Background: Infections may be associated with exacerbation of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, epidemiological and experimental data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at the origin of the increased incidence of both Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases and Th2-mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and autoimmunity. Methods and Findings: Here, we performed a systematic study of the disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists using two experimental models, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, presenting the same genetic background of the non obese diabetic mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both pathologies. In the same models, we also investigated the effect of probiotics. Additionally, we examined the effect of the genetic invalidation of MyD88 on the development of allergic asthma and spontaneous diabetes. We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally. Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases. The physiological relevance of these findings is further suggested by the major acceleration of OVA-induced asthma in MyD88 invalidated mice. Our results strongly indicate that the TLR-mediated effects involve immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and different subsets of regulatory T cells, notably CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells for TLR4 agonists and NKT cells for TLR3 agonists. Conclusions/Significance: These observations demonstrate that systemic administration of TLR ligands can suppress both allergic and autoimmune responses. They provide a plausible explanation for the hygiene hypothesis. They also open new therapeutic perspectives for the prevention of these pathologies.},

Abstract = {Background: The incidence of type 1 diabetes in Europe is increasing at a rate of about 3\% per year and there is also an increasing incidence throughout the world. Type 1 diabetes is a complex disease caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) have been suggested as a triggering factor for developing childhood type 1 diabetes. The aim of this case-control study was to assess possible impacts of in utero exposure to POPs on type 1 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was performed as a case-control study within a biobank in Malmo, a city located in the Southern part of Sweden. The study included 150 cases (children who had their diagnosis mostly before 18 years of age) and 150 controls, matched for gender and day of birth. 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) and the major DDT metabolite 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) were used as a biomarkers for POP exposure. When comparing the quartile with the highest maternal serum concentrations of PCB-153 with the other quartiles, an odds ratio (OR) of 0.73 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.42, 1.27) was obtained. Similar results was obtained for p,p'-DDE (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.29, 1.08). Conclusions: The hypothesis that in utero exposure to POPs will trigger the risk for developing type 1 diabetes was not supported by the results. The risk estimates did, although not statistically significant, go in the opposite direction. However, it is not reasonable to believe that exposure to POPs should protect against type 1 diabetes.},

Abstract = {Background: Autonomic neuropathy is a common and serious complication of diabetes. Early detection is essential to enable appropriate interventional therapy and management. Dynamic pupillometry has been proposed as a simpler and more sensitive tool to detect subclinical autonomic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate pupil responsiveness in diabetic subjects with and without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) using dynamic pupillometry in two sets of experiments. Methods: During the first experiment, one flash was administered and the pupil response was recorded for 3 s. In the second experiment, 25 flashes at 1-s interval were administered and the pupil response was recorded for 30 s. Several time and pupil-iris radius-related parameters were computed from the acquired data. A total of 24 diabetic subjects (16 without and 8 with CAN) and 16 healthy volunteers took part in the study. Results: Our results show that diabetic subjects with and without CAN have sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, evidenced by diminished amplitude reflexes and significant smaller pupil radius. It suggests that pupillary autonomic dysfunction occurs before a more generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, and this could be used to detect early autonomic dysfunction. Conclusions: Dynamic pupillometry provides a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive tool to screen high-risk diabetic patients for diabetic autonomic neuropathy.},

Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are associated with body mass index (BMI) in populations of European descent. The FTO rs9939609 variant, first detected in a genome-wide association study of diabetes, conferred an increased disease risk that was abolished after adjustment for BMI, suggesting that the association may be due to variation in adiposity. The relationship between diabetes, four previously identified FTO polymorphisms that span a 19.6-kb genomic region, and obesity was therefore evaluated in the biracial population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study with the goal of further refining the association by comparing results between the two ethnic groups. The prevalence of diabetes and obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) was established at baseline, and diabetes was determined by either self-report, a fasting glucose level >= 126 mg/dL, or non-fasting glucose >= 200 mg/dL. There were 1,004 diabetes cases and 10,038 non-cases in whites, and 670 cases and 2,780 non-cases in African-Americans. Differences in mean BMI were assessed by a general linear model, and multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the risk of diabetes and obesity. For white participants, the FTO rs9939609 A allele was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, p < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 1.22, p < 0.001) under an additive genetic model that was similar for all of the SNPs analyzed. In African-Americans, only the rs1421085 C allele was a determinant of obesity risk (OR = 1.17, p = 0.05), but was found to be protective against diabetes (OR = 0.79, p = 0.03). Adjustment for BMI did not eliminate any of the observed associations with diabetes. Significant statistical interaction between race and the FTO variants suggests that the effect on diabetes susceptibility may be context dependent.},

Abstract = {Background: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Methods and Findings: We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration >= 126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p<0.001), and the vitamin c-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p<0.001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170 (adjusted OR 2.2; p<0.001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T2D included b-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p<0.001). Conclusions and Significance: Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by GWAS.},

Abstract = {Acupuncture (ACU) is known to be effective in ischemia treatment, and glutamate (GLU) excitotoxicity is an important factor in neuronal cell death. We observed the effect of ACU on cerebral blood flow (\%CBF) and Delta GLU (the changes in GLU release) in the ischemic stroke rat model of diabetic mellitus (DM). A global ischemia was induced using the eleven-vessel occlusion (11-VO) method in 14 Sprague-Dawley rats (DM), which were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the ACU-treatment group. Extracellular Delta GLU was assessed using an intra-cerebral biosensor system measuring 256 samples per second, simultaneously with \%CBF and electroencephalogram. ACU stimulation was applied to ACU points GB34 and GB39 during the ischemic period. Twenty-three diagnostic parameters were proposed first for a detailed analysis of changes in \%CBF and GLU release during ischemia/reperfusion. ACU rats showed a significant decrease in ischemic (p < 0.05) and reperfusion \%CBF (p < 0.0001) than control rats, and a significantly larger decrease in ischemic Delta GLU (p < 0.05) and peak level of reperfusion Delta GLU (p < 0.005) than control rats. From these results, we suggest that ACU stimulation is responsible for the potential protection of neurons through suppression of \%CBF response in the increased plasma osmolality and extracellular Delta GLU in diabetic rats under ischemic conditions.},

Abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, to investigate the pathophysiological interaction between these diseases, we generated animal models that reflect the pathologic conditions of both diseases. We crossed Alzheimer transgenic mice (APP23) with two types of diabetic mice (ob/ob and NSY mice), and analyzed their metabolic and brain pathology. The onset of diabetes exacerbated Alzheimer-like cognitive dysfunction without an increase in brain amyloid-beta burden in double-mutant (APP(+)-ob/ob) mice. Notably, APP(+)-ob/ob mice showed cerebrovascular inflammation and severe amyloid angiopathy. Conversely, the cross-bred mice showed an accelerated diabetic phenotype compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting that Alzheimer amyloid pathology could aggravate diabetes. Similarly, APP(+)-NSY fusion mice showed more severe glucose intolerance compared with diabetic NSY mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet feeding induced severe memory deficits in APP(+)-NSY mice without an increase in brain amyloid-beta load. Here, we created Alzheimer mouse models with early onset of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebrovascular changes and alteration in brain insulin signaling might play a pivotal role in this relationship. These findings could provide insights into this intensely debated association.},

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease that affects a large number of people, and the number of problems associated with the disease has been increasing in the past few decades. These problems include cardiovascular disorders, blindness and the eventual need to amputate limbs. Therefore, the quality of life for people living with DM is less than it is for healthy people. In several cases, metabolic syndrome (MS), which can be considered a disturbance of the lipid metabolism, is associated with DM. In this work, two drugs used to treat DM, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, were studied using theoretical methods, and their molecular properties were related to the biological activity of these drugs. From the results, it was possible to correlate the properties of each substance-particularly electronic properties-with the biological interactions that are linked to their pharmacological effects. These results suggest that there are future prospects for designing or developing new drugs based on the correlation between theoretical and experimental properties.},

Abstract = {Aims: The gastrointestinal hormone GIP promotes pancreatic islet function and exerts pro-survival actions on cultured beta-cells. However, GIP also promotes lipogenesis, thus potentially restricting its therapeutic use. The current studies evaluated the effects of a truncated GIP analog, D-Ala(2)-GIP(1-30) (D-GIP(1-30)), on glucose homeostasis and beta-cell mass in rat models of diabetes. Materials and Methods: The insulinotropic and pro-survival potency of D-GIP(1-30) was evaluated in perfused pancreas preparations and cultured INS-1 beta-cells, respectively, and receptor selectivity evaluated using wild type and GIP receptor knockout mice. Effects of D-GIP(1-30) on beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis, in vivo, were determined using Lean Zucker rats, obese Vancouver diabetic fatty rats, streptozotocin treated rats, and obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats, with effects on beta-cell mass determined in histological studies of pancreatic tissue. Lipogenic effects of D-GIP(1-30) were evaluated on cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Results: Acutely, D-GIP(1-30) improved glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Chronic treatment with D-GIP(1-30) reduced levels of islet pro-apoptotic proteins in Vancouver diabetic fatty rats and preserved beta-cell mass in streptozotocin treated rats and Zucker diabetic fatty rats, resulting in improved insulin responses and glycemic control in each animal model, with no change in body weight. In in vitro studies, D-GIP(1-30) exhibited equivalent potency to GIP(1-42) on beta-cell function and survival, but greatly reduced action on lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that truncated forms of GIP exhibit potent anti-diabetic actions, without pro-obesity effects, and that the C-terminus contributes to the lipogenic actions of GIP.},

Abstract = {Consistent tight blood sugar control in critically ill patients has proven elusive. Properly accounting for the saturation of insulin action and reducing the need for frequent measurements are important aspects in intensive insulin therapy. This paper presents a composite metabolic model, `Glucosafe', that integrates models and parameters from normal physiology and accounts for the reduced rate of glucose gut absorption and saturation of insulin action in patients with reduced insulin sensitivity. Particularly, two different sites of reduced insulin sensitivity, before and after the non-linearity of insulin action, are explored with this model. These approaches are assessed based on the model's accuracy in retrospectively predicting blood glucose measurements of 10 randomly chosen, hyperglycemic intensive care patients. For each patient, median absolute percent error is <25\% for prediction times <= 270 min and modelling reduced insulin sensitivity after the non-linearity, compared to <29\% for modelling reduced insulin sensitivity before the non-linearity. Scaling the insulin effect (after the non-linearity) is a suitable assumption in this model structure. These results are preliminary and subject to further and more extensive validation of the model's capability to predict the longer term (>2 h) blood glucose excursion in critically ill patients.

Abstract = {A novel combination of iterative learning control (ILC) and model predictive control (MPC), referred to here as model predictive iterative learning control (MPILC), is proposed for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus. MPILC exploits two key factors: frequent glucose readings made possible by continuous glucose monitoring technology; and the repetitive nature of glucose-meal-insulin dynamics with a 24-h cycle. The proposed algorithm can learn from an individual's lifestyle, allowing the control performance to be improved from day to day. After less than 10 days, the blood glucose concentrations can be kept within a range of 90-170 mg/dL. Generally, control performance under MPILC is better than that under MPC. The proposed methodology is robust to random variations in meal timings within +/-60 min or meal amounts within +/-75\% of the nominal value, which validates MPILC's superior robustness compared to run-to-run control. Moreover, to further improve the algorithm's robustness, an automatic scheme for setpoint update that ensures safe convergence is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require user intervention; hence, the algorithm should be of particular interest for glycemic control in children and adolescents.},

Abstract = {Changes in morphology of the skin are an important factor that can affect non-invasive measurements performed through this organ, in particular for glucose monitoring in e. g. patients with diabetes mellitus. A characterization technique for non-contact in vivo profiling of the superficial skin layers can be beneficial for evaluation of the performance of such measurement systems. We applied a full-field optical coherence tomography (OCT) system followed by the fully automatic processing for this task. With the developed procedure, non-invasive quantification of the skin morphology can be performed within a few minutes. The dorsal skin of the upper arm of 22 patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus was investigated with an OCT system and with a commercially available dermatological laser scanning confocal microscope (CM) as a reference method. The estimates of epidermal thickness from OCT were compared with the results of expert-assisted analysis of confocal images. The highest correlation with the CM measurements has been obtained for the distance from the entrance peak to the first minimum of the OCT reflection profile ((R) over bar (2) = 0.657, p < 0.0001). In this specific patient group, we have observed a statistically significant correlation of the subjects' body mass index with the distance from the entrance peak to the dermal reflection peak in the OCT profile (p = 0.010). Furthermore, the same OCT parameter is negatively correlated with age with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.062). At the same time, no relation of diabetes-related parameters (duration of disease and concentration of glycated haemoglobin) to the skin morphology observed with the OCT and CM was found.},

Abstract = {The DIAdvisor (TM) is an EC/FP7 funded project aiming at the development of a Blood Glucose prediction device which uses easily available information to optimise the therapy of patients with diabetes. The project will achieve its objectives by developing a unique system for patients with diabetes to help them manage their disease effectively, optimising safety and giving an improved quality of life. One main outcome of DIAdvisor will be to reduce the negative effects of long-term hyperglycaemia with no increased occurrence of hypoglycaemia. A comprehensive clinical database has been established and utilised for systems development. In-silico testing shows promising results. In parallel a device platform has been developed for running these systems. During early 2010 a first prototype has been exposed to extensive in-vitro validation and is now undergoing clinical testing.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to design and develop a Decision Support System (DSS) closely coupled with an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), able to predict the risk of a Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patient to develop retinopathy. The proposed system is able to store a wealth of information regarding the clinical state of the T1DM patient and continuously provide the health experts with predictions regarding the possible future complications that he may present. The DSS is a hybrid infrastructure combining a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Rule Induction C5.0 classifier, with an improved Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network (iHWNN). A voting mechanism is utilized to merge the results from the four classification models. The proposed DSS has been trained and evaluated using data from 55 T1DM patients, acquired by the Athens Hippokration Hospital in close collaboration with the EURODIAB research team. The DSS has shown an excellent performance resulting in an accuracy of 98\%. Care has been taken to design and implement a consistent and continuously evolving Information Technology (IT) system by utilizing technologies such as smart agents periodically triggered to retrain the DSS with new cases added in the data repository.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a prediction algorithm for blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes. An iPhone application was developed that allows patients to record their daily blood glucose levels and provide them with relevant feedback using the prediction algorithm to help control their blood glucose levels. Several methods using theoretical functions were tested to select the most accurate prediction method. The prediction is adjusted with each glucose reading input by the patient taking into consideration the time of the glucose reading and the time after the patient's last meal, as well as any physical activity. The individualized prediction algorithm was tested and verified with real patient data and also validated using a non-parametric regression method. The accuracy of prediction results varied from different approaches and was adequate for most of the methods tested. The predicted results merged closer to the patients' actual glucose readings after each additional input reading. The findings of the research were encouraging and the predictive system provided what we believe to be helpful feedback to control, improve, and take proactive measures to regulate blood glucose levels.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a personal diabetes monitoring system which integrates wearable sensors, 3G mobile phone, smart home technologies and Google Health to facilitate the management of chronic disease - diabetes. Our system utilizes wearable sensors and 3G cellular phone to automatically collect physical signs, such as blood glucose level and blood pressure. It allows users, especially seniors with diabetes, to conveniently record daily test results and track long term health condition changes regardless of their locations. It does so without having to ask users to manually input them into the system. Our system also utilizes Google Health to manage Personal Health Records (PHRs), which not only bridges the gaps between patients and different health care providers but enabling accesses to patients' PHRs anywhere and anytime by taking advantage of the universal accessibility of Google Health.},

Abstract = {Demographic change in regard to an aging population with an increasing amount of diabetes patients will put a strain on health care rentability in all modern societies. Electronic living assistants for diabetes patients might help lift the burden on taxpayers, if they are usable for the heterogeneous user group. Research has shown that correct mental models of device menu structures might help users in handling electronic devices. This exploratory study investigates construction and facilitation of spatial mental models for a menu structure of a diabetes living assistant and relates them to performance in usage of a device. Furthemore impact of age, domain knowledge and technical expertise on complexity and quality of the mental model are evaluated. Results indicate that even having a simplified spatial representation of the menu structure increases navigation performance. Interestingly not the overall correctness of the model was important for task success but rather the amount of route knowledge within the model.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a breath analysis system that makes use of chemical sensors to detect acetone in human breath, and hence detect the diabetes and measure the blood glucose levels of diabetics. We captured the breath samples from healthy persons and patients known to be afflicted with diabetes and conducted experiments on disease identification and simultaneous blood glucose measurement. SVM classifier was used to identify diabetes from healthy samples and three models were built to fit the curves that can represent the blood glucose levels. The results show that the system is not only able to distinguish between breath samples from patients with diabetes and healthy subjects, but also to represent the fluctuation of blood sugar of diabetics and therefore to be an evaluation tool for monitoring the blood glucose of diabetes.},

Abstract = {The current diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus are controversial because they lack correlation to maternal and perinatal outcome. The results of the hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcome (HAPO) study demonstrate a linear association between increasing levels of fasting, 1- and 2-h plasma glucose post a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test to several significant outcome endpoints, such as birth weight above the 90th percentile, cord blood serum C-peptide level above the 90th percentile, primary cesarean delivery, clinical neonatal hypoglycemia, premature delivery, shoulder dystocia or birth injury, intensive neonatal care admission, hyperbilirubinemia, and preeclampsia. A consensus report by the IADPSG, based on a vigorous assessment of the HAPO results and other studies, recommended an endorsement of risk-based, internationally accepted criteria for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes in pregnancy. This review follows the steps from defining the problem to the endpoint of achieving a worldwide policy change.},

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by a lack of insulin, insulin resistance, or both. There is increasing evidence that insulin also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it is involved in the metabolism of beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau, two proteins that form A beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively, the hallmark lesions in AD. Here, we examined the effects of experimental DM on a pre-existing tau pathology in the pR5 transgenic mouse strain that is characterized by NFTs. pR5 mice express P301L mutant human tau that is associated with dementia. Experimental DM was induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which causes insulin deficiency. We determined phosphorylation of tau, using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Solubility of tau was determined upon extraction with sarkosyl and formic acid, and Gallyas silver staining was employed to reveal NFTs. Insulin depletion by STZ administration in six months-old non-transgenic mice causes increased tau phosphorylation, without its deposition or NFT formation. In contrast, in pR5 mice this results in massive deposition of hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau. Furthermore, they develop a pronounced tau-histopathology, including NFTs at this early age, while the pathology in sham-treated pR5 mice is moderate. Whereas experimental DM did not result in deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in non-transgenic mice, a predisposition to develop a tau pathology in young pR5 mice was both sufficient and necessary to exacerbate tau deposition and NFT formation. Hence, DM can accelerate onset and increase severity of disease in individuals with a predisposition to developing tau pathology.},

Abstract = {Semiparametric models are becoming increasingly attractive for longitudinal data analysis. often there is lack of knowledge of the covariance structure of the response variable. Although it is still possible to obtain consistent estimators for both parametric and nonparametric components of a semipatrametric model by assuming an identity structure for the covariance matrix, the resulting estimators may not be efficient. We conducted extensive simulation studies to investigate the impact of an unknown covariance structure on estimators in semiparametric models for longitudinal data. In some situations the loss of efficiency could be substantial. A two-step estimator is thus proposed to improve the efficiency. Our study was motivated by a population based data analysis to examine the temporal relationship between systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Backround: A meta-analysis combining results from three genome-wide association studies and followed by large-scale replication identified six novel type 2 diabetes loci. Subsequent studies of the effect of these variants on estimates of the beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity have been inconclusive. We examined these variants located in or near the JAZF1 (rs864745), THADA (rs7578597), TSPAN8 (rs7961581), ADAMTS9 (rs4607103), NOTCH2 (rs10923931) and the CDC123/CAMK1D (rs12779790) genes for associations with measures of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. Methodology/Results: Oral and intravenous glucose stimulated insulin release (n=849) and insulin sensitivity (n=596) estimated from a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were measured in non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic patients from five European populations. Assuming an additive genetic model the diabetes-associated major C-allele of rs4607103 near ADAMTS9 associated with reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p=0.002) during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. However, following intravenous and oral administration of glucose serum insulin release was increased in individuals with the C-allele (p=0.003 and p=0.01, respectively). A meta-analyse combining clamp and IVGTT data from a total of 905 non-diabetic individuals showed that the C-risk allele associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (p=0.003) and increased insulin release (p=0.002). The major T-allele of the intronic JAZF1 rs864745 conferring increased diabetes risk was associated with increased 2(nd) phase serum insulin release during an IVGTT (p=0.03), and an increased fasting serum insulin level (p=0.001). The remaining variants did not show any associations with insulin response, insulin sensitivity or any other measured quantitative traits. Conclusion: The present studies suggest that the diabetogenic impact of the C-allele of rs4607103 near ADAMTS9 may in part be mediated through decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues.},

Abstract = {Inflammatory burden is high in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients. In Diabetic ESRD patients, the balance between pro- and anti-oxidant activities is shifted towards an oxidative stress. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a bactericidal enzyme plays an active role in induction and evolution of the endothelial dysfunction associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). However, whether MPO can serve as a marker in diabetic ESRD patients is doubtful. Hence, the present study was undertaken. The Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Serum Myeloperoxidase levels were estimated in three different groups with 30 subjects each. The Control group includes healthy individuals, group I constitutes Type 2 diabetes with no nephropathy and group II includes Type 2 diabetes with nephropathy patients. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was calculated using Cockcroft Gault formula corrected for the Body Surface Area. Statistical software, namely, SPSS 15.0, Stata 8.0, MedCalc 9.0.1 and Systat 11.0 were used for the analysis of the data and Microsoft word and Excel have been used to generate graphs, tables etc. Reference Ranges for MPO were established in our study. An increase in MPO levels was noticed in Group I, whereas a differential behaviour of MPO levels was noted in group II. Uremic diabetic nephropathy patients with a low MPO level may be at a lesser risk for any cardiac event compared to those uremic patients with high MPO levels. Hence, MPO may be taken as a biomarker to predict coronary events in diabetic ESRD.},

Abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin therapy on bone density around osseointegrated dental implants by digital subtraction radiography (DSR). Material and methods Forty implants were placed in tibiae of 40 adult rats. After a healing period of 2 months, the animals were divided into four groups of 10 animals each: a 2-month control group, sacrificed at time (A), a diabetic group (D), an insulin-treated group (I) and a 4-month control group (C). During 2 months, group I received subcutaneous doses of insulin, whereas groups C and D received only saline. The animals in groups D, I and C were thereafter sacrificed. The glucose plasma levels (GPLs) were monitored throughout the experiment. Film radiographs were taken at implant surgery and on the day of sacrifice. The radiographs were digitized, and bone density in regions of osseointegration (OR) around the implants was evaluated by quantitative DSR between baseline and final images. Differences in shades of gray among the groups were assessed using ANOVA. Results GPLs were within normal range for groups A, C and I and higher for group D. There was a significant difference in mean gray shade values in the OR of subtraction images between groups D (122 +/- 7) and I (136 +/- 5) (P < 0.05) while there were no significant differences between control groups A (128 +/- 13) and C (134 +/- 10) and the insulin group I. Conclusions DM impaired bone density around osseointegrated dental implant. Further, insulin therapy maintained bone density in diabetic rats.

Abstract = {This paper presents a case-based decision support system prototype to assist patients with Type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. These patients must vigilantly maintain blood glucose levels within prescribed target ranges to prevent serious disease complications, including blindness, neuropathy, and heart failure. Case-based reasoning (CBR) was selected for this domain because (a) existing guidelines for managing diabetes are general and must be tailored to individual patient needs; (b) physical and lifestyle factors combine to influence blood glucose levels; and (c) CBR has been successfully applied to the management of other long-term medical conditions. An institutional review board (IRB) approved preliminary clinical study, involving 20 patients, was conducted to assess the feasibility of providing case-based decision support for these patients. Fifty cases were compiled in a case library, situation assessment routines were encoded to detect common problems in blood glucose control, and retrieval metrics were developed to find the most relevant past cases for solving current problems. Preliminary results encourage continued research and work toward development of a practical tool for patients.},

Abstract = {Context: Telemedicine is a promising but largely unproven technology for providing case management services to patients with chronic conditions and lower access to care. Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention to achieve clinical management goals in older, ethnically diverse, medically underserved patients with diabetes. Design, Setting, and Patients: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing telemedicine case management to usual care, with blinded outcome evaluation, in 1,665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Interventions: Home telemedicine unit with nurse case management versus usual care. Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoints assessed over 5 years of follow-up were hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. Results: Intention-to-treat mixed models showed that telemedicine achieved net overall reductions over five years of follow-up in the primary endpoints (HgbA1c, p = 0.001; LDL, p < 0.001; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.024; p < 0.001). Estimated differences (95\% CI) in year 5 were 0.29 (0.12, 0.46)\% for HgbA1c, 3.84 (-0.08, 7.77) mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, and 4.32 (1.93, 6.72) mm Hg for systolic and 2.64 (1.53, 3,74) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure. There were 176 deaths in the intervention group and 169 in the usual care group (hazard ratio 1.01 [0.82, 1.24]). Conclusions: Telemedicine case management resulted in net improvements in HgbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years in medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was not different between the groups, although power was limited.},

Abstract = {Background: Type 2 diabetes is treated in a stepwise manner, progressing from diet and physical activity to oral antidiabetic agents and insulin. The oral agent pioglitazone is licensed for use with insulin when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the extent to which adding pioglitazone to insulin-containing regimens produces benefits in terms of patient-relevant outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight, and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised according to standard systematic review methodology and in a meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092 patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12 weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45 mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58\% (95\% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p<0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly more frequent in the pioglitazone arms ( relative risk 1.27; 95\% CI: 0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes. Conclusions/Significance: When added to insulin regimens, pioglitazone confers a small advantage in terms of HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients with previous inadequate glucose control, but at the cost of increased hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Other considerations include the risk of heart failure, fractures in women, a reduced insulin dose, and the net financial cost.},

Abstract = {Xenotransplantation of pig tissues has great potential to overcome the shortage of organ donors. One approach to address the vigorous immune rejection associated with xenotransplants is the use of embryonic precursor tissue, which induces and utilizes host vasculature upon its growth and development. Recently, we showed in mice that embryonic pig pancreatic tissue from embryonic day 42 (E42) exhibits optimal properties as a beta cell replacement therapy. We now demonstrate the proof of concept in 2 diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys, followed for 393 and 280 days, respectively. A marked reduction of exogenous insulin requirement was noted by the fourth month after transplantation, reaching complete independence from exogenous insulin during the fifth month after transplantation, with full physiological control of blood glucose levels. The porcine origin of insulin was documented by a radioimmunoassay specific for porcine C-peptide. Furthermore, the growing tissue was found to be predominantly vascularized with host blood vessels, thereby evading hyperacute or acute rejection, which could potentially be mediated by preexisting anti-pig antibodies. Durable graft protection was achieved, and most of the late complications could be attributed to the immunosuppressive protocol. While fine tuning of immune suppression, tissue dose, and implantation techniques are still required, our results demonstrate that porcine E-42 embryonic pancreatic tissue can normalize blood glucose levels in primates. Its long-term proliferative capacity, its revascularization by host endothelium, and its reduced immunogenicity, strongly suggest that this approach could offer an attractive replacement therapy for diabetes.},

Abstract = {Background: The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) was a randomized controlled trial, which showed that it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes by lifestyle changes. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the lifestyle intervention had an effect on the ten-year mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in the DPS participants originally randomized either into an intervention or control group. Furthermore, we compared these results with a population-based cohort comprising individuals of varying glucose tolerance states. Methods and Findings: Middle-aged, overweight people with IGT (n=522) were randomized into intensive intervention (including physical activity, weight reduction and dietary counseling), or control ``mini-intervention'' group. Median length of the intervention period was 4 years and the mean follow-up was 10.6 years. The population-based reference study cohort included 1881 individuals (1570 with normal glucose tolerance, 183 with IGT, 59 with screen-detected type 2 diabetes, 69 with previously known type 2 diabetes) with the mean follow-up of 13.8 years. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity data were collected from the national Hospital Discharge Register and Causes of Death Register. Among the DPS participants who consented for register linkage (n=505), total mortality (2.2 vs. 3.8 per 1000 person years, hazard ratio HR=0.57, 95\% CI 0.21-1.58) and cardiovascular morbidity (22.9 vs. 22.0 per 1000 person years, HR=1.04, 95\% CI 0.72-1.51) did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups. Compared with the population-based cohort with impaired glucose tolerance, adjusted HRs were 0.21 (95\% CI 0.09-0.52) and 0.39 (95\% CI 0.20-0.79) for total mortality, and 0.89 (95\% CI 0.62-1.27) and 0.87 (0.60-1.27) for cardiovascular morbidity in the intervention and control groups of the DPS, respectively. The risk of death in DPS combined cohort was markedly lower than in FINRISK IGT cohort (adjusted HR 0.30, 95\% CI 0.17-0.54), but there was no significant difference in the risk of CVD (adjusted HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.64-1.21). Conclusions: Lifestyle intervention among persons with IGT did not decrease cardiovascular morbidity during the first 10 years of follow-up. However, the statistical power may not be sufficient to detect small differences between the intervention and control groups. Low total mortality among participants of the DPS compared with individuals with IGT in the general population could be ascribed to a lower cardiovascular risk profile at baseline and regular follow-up.},

Abstract = {Diabetes occurs when a body is unable to produce or respond properly to insulin which is needed to regulate glucose. Besides contributing to heart disease, diabetes also increases the risks of developing kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, and blood vessel damage. Diabetes disease diagnosis via proper interpretation of the diabetes data is an important classification problem. In this study, a comparative pima-diabetes disease diagnosis was realized. For this purpose. a multilayer neural network structure which was trained by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and a probabilistic neural network structure were used. The results of the study were compared with the results of the pervious studies reported focusing on diabetes disease diagnosis and using the same LICI machine learning database.

Abstract = {The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but gene targeting technology is not established for this species. Therefore, we aimed to produce transgenic knockdown rats using shRNA technology and pronuclear microinjection. To this purpose, we employed a tetracycline-inducible shRNA expression system targeting the insulin receptor (IR). Doxycycline (DOX) treatment of the resulting transgenic rats led to a dose-dependent and reversible increase in blood glucose caused by ubiquitous inhibition of IR expression and signalling. We could neither detect an interferon response nor disturbances in microRNA processing after DOX treatment excluding toxic effects of shRNA expression. Low dose DOX treatment induced a chronic state of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, we have developed a technology which allows the specific, inducible, and reversible suppression of any gene of interest in the rat. Our first transgenic rat line generated with this method represents an inducible model for diabetes mellitus.},

Abstract = {Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity have become two of the main threats to public health in the Western world. In addition, obesity is the most important determinant of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), a condition that adversely affects glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown whether patients with diabetes have more severe SAHS than non-diabetic subjects. The aim of this cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate whether obese patients with T2DM are more prone to severe SAHS than obese non-diabetic subjects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the percentage of time spent at saturations below 90\% (CT90). A high prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM: 80\%, nondiabetic: 78.3\%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected (20.2 +/- 30.2\% vs. 6.8 +/- 13,5\%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted: 79.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 100.1 +/- 22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with CT90. Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory.},

Abstract = {Background: Observational studies suggested an association between diabetes and the risk of various geriatric conditions (i.e., cognitive impairment, dementia, depression, mobility impairment, disability, falls, and urinary incontinence). However, the magnitude and impact of diabetes on older adults have not been reviewed. Methodology/Principal Findings: MEDLINE and PSYCINFO databases were searched through November 2007 for published studies, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key articles. Population-based, prospective cohort studies that reported risk of geriatric outcomes in relation to diabetes status at baseline were selected. Two authors independently extracted the data, including study population and follow-up duration, ascertainment of diabetes status at baseline, outcomes of interest and their ascertainment, adjusted covariates, measures of association, and brief results. Fifteen studies examined the association of DM with cognitive dysfunction. DM was associated with a faster decline in cognitive function among older adults. The pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR) for all dementia when persons with DM were compared to those without was 1.47 (95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.73). Summary RRs for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia comparing persons with DM to those without were 1.39 (CI, 1.16 to 1.66) and 2.38 (CI, 1.79 to 3.18), respectively. Four of 5 studies found significant association of DM with faster mobility decline and incident disability. Two studies examined the association of diabetes with falls in older women. Both found statistically significant associations. Insulin users had higher RR for recurrent falls. One study for urinary incontinence in older women found statistically significant associations. Two studies for depression did not suggest that DM was an independent predictor of incident depression. Conclusions/Significance: Current evidence supports that DM is associated with increased risk for selected geriatric conditions. Clinicians should increase their awareness and provide appropriate care. Future research is required to elucidate the underlying pathological pathway.},

Abstract = {Recurrence and complication prevention is crucial in caring chronic patients. This paper presents a chronic disease recurrence prediction model in long-term caring for diabetes patients. A nursing information system is developed and applied in an institution-based health care center. Values of blood sugar, vital signs, BMI and nursing records of diabetes patients are collected during the daily nursing procedure. Since data are recorded in different time with variable sampling period, a flexible time series analysis method is presented for exploiting seasonal variation and cyclical fluctuation between diabetes and daily-recorded signals. Expert knowledge for chronic disease is built based on domain specific language to extract chronic disease care knowledge from nursing records. Finally, a health surveillance system is developed by integrating multi-modal daily caring information for long-term caring of chronic patients. Several experiments with statistical testing are conducted and the results compare the performance of the proposed method. The expected outcome will build a prediction model to early warning before diabetes will be recurrence.},

Abstract = {The chronic disease diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. It is caused by absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, and is associated with a range of severe complications including renal and cardiovascular disease as well as blindness. Preventive care helps in controlling the severity of this disease, however, preventive measures require correct educational awareness and routine health checks. Medical doctors help in effective diagnosis as well as treatment of diabetes, although it is associated with high costs. With this view, the purpose of the present research is to develop a low-cost automated knowledge-based system that helps in self-diagnosis and management of this chronic disease for patients as well as doctors. Our knowledge-based system has an easy computer interface, which performs the diagnostic tasks using rules acquired from medical doctors on the basis of patient data. At present our system consists of 26 rules and it has been implemented using Prolog programming. Some real-life experimentations were performed, which confirmed the effectiveness of the developed system.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that an elevated serum ferritin concentration is considered an independent factor associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is inversely associated with diabetes. The cross-sectional study investigates 6,230 participants' data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, The Cooper Institute (Dallas, Texas). The authors explored whether CRF level is associated inversely with lower serum ferritin concentration and is associated with a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Participants with high ferritin levels and high triglyceride were 1.89 and 1.57 times, respectively, more likely to have diabetes. Overweight or obese individuals were 1.35 to 1.40 times more likely to have diabetes. Participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes were 3.96 times more likely to have diabetes. Lower serum ferritin concentration was associated with lower risk of diabetes in those participating in cardiorespiratory fitness. It suggests that physicians may use patients' ferritin concentrations as a marker for predicting their risk for new-onset diabetes, and patients should be encouraged to participate in cardiorespiratory fitness or physical activities.},

Abstract = {Good blood glucose control is important to people with type 1 diabetes to prevent diabetes-related complications. Too much blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) causes long-term micro-vascular complications, while a severe drop in blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) can cause life-threatening coma. Finding the right balance between quantity and type of food intake, physical activity levels and insulin dosage, is a daily challenge. Increased physical activity levels often cause changes in blood glucose due to increased glucose uptake into tissues such as muscle. To date we have limited knowledge about the minute by minute effects of exercise on blood glucose levels, in part due to the difficulty in measuring glucose and physical activity levels continuously, in a free-living environment. By using a light and user-friendly armband we can record physical activity energy expenditure on a minute-by-minute basis. Simultaneously, by using a continuous glucose monitoring system we can record glucose concentrations. In this paper, Gaussian Processes are used to model the glucose excursions in response to physical activity data, to study its effect on glycaemic control.},

Abstract = {METABO is a diabetes monitoring and management system which aims at recording and interpreting patient's context, as well as, at providing decision support to both the patient and the doctor. The METABO system consists of (a) a Patient's Mobile Device (PMD), (b) different types of unobtrusive biosensors, (c) a Central Subsystem (CS) located remotely at the hospital and (d) the Control Panel (CP) from which physicians can follow-up their patients and gain also access to the CS. METABO provides a multi-parametric monitoring system which facilitates the efficient and systematic recording of dietary, physical activity, medication and medical information (continuous and discontinuous glucose measurements). Based on all recorded contextual information, data mining schemes that run in the PMD are responsible to model patients' metabolism, predict hypo/hyper-glycaemic events, and provide the patient with short and long-term alerts. In addition, all past and recently-recorded data are analyzed to extract patterns of behavior, discover new knowledge and provide explanations to the physician through the CP. Advanced tools in the CP allow the physician to prescribe personalized treatment plans and frequently quantify patient's adherence to treatment.},

Abstract = {The use of mobile technologies for self-monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure for diabetes patients is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. This is propelled by the proliferation of the wider usage of mobile phones and other wireless technologies and computing platforms in the healthcare sector. Such technologies can play a pivotal role in chronic disease management and patient self-care. There have been several clinical trials in recent years on mobile diabetes management in UK and Canada. However, no studies to date have addressed and correlated the technological and clinical outcomes concerning the use of mobile chronic disease management systems for diabetes from the UK and Canadian perspectives. In this paper we address some of these correlative issues based on similar clinical trials on mobile type-2 diabetes management systems deployed in these two countries. In particular, the outcomes of these trials supported the use of telemonitoring for effective blood pressure control, but telemonitoring was less effective at managing blood glucose control. Some of the clinical results and challenges are presented together with future work and suggestions that aim to validate a generic platform for mobile diabetes management.},

The added abilities that come from the hybrid approaches motivate their use in every system. Bio-Medical Engineering is yet another field which has seen a major change in he past few years. We find various new approaches being applied to this field as well as many new models being proposed. At this juncture, we study the effectiveness of various new hybrid approaches in the field of Bio-medicals in this paper. PIMA Indian database has been used for this purpose from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The basic aim is to compare the various hybrid approaches from the recent literature and compare their performances. We have chosen 3 major Hybrid Systems and standard Back Propagation Algorithm for this purpose. These are Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, Ensembles and Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks. We also try to explain the results from our theoretical understanding of the individual Hybrid Systems.},

Abstract = {In this chapter we evaluate the ability of the minimal model of glucose disappearance to describe experimental data collected from 9 diabetic patients controlled subcutaneously by an insulin pump. Two versions of the minimal model are used: the nonlinear classic minimal model developed by Bergman et al. (MM) and the linear approximation proposed by Fernandez et al. (LMM). All data windows (n = 13) show residuals that are correlated for both the LMM and MM (p-value < 0.01). The results also show that both the LMM and MM provide an equivalent goodness of fit with R-2 C values that are statistically equivalent (p-value > 0.05). This study confirms that the minimal model of glucose disappearance, either the classic or linear version, is unable to describe the observed experimental data possibly as a result of the physiological constraints imposed by the minimal model approach on the system dynamics, together with possible errors derived from the unmeasured insulin dynamics. Further testing on more complex models should be performed.},

In such scenario, the multiagent technology supports the distributed autonomy of several Personal Assistants; the communications between them and the hospital's agents; the control of the system's access and multitask functionality; scalability; adaptability; robustness; and the provision to the physicians with the necessary automatic processing tools for the analysis of the large amounts of data generated by patients. We evaluated the AOIS meta-model and the CAMLE's modelling environment concluding that this methodology is adequate to represent a complex medical system like the one presented. The model and the formal specification provide a more complete view of the system and contain very useful information to cope with the future system evolution.},

Abstract = {The incidence of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Maintaining tight glycemic control is essential to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications as demonstrated by many studies. Current recommendation for HbAlc is less then 7\% and even 6.5\% in special individuals. HbAlc measurement is considered the gold standard of diabetes care and serves as a surrogate of diabetes-related complications, but it does not provide information about glycemic excursions. For these reasons, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels is considered an important adjunct to HbAlc measurements for achieving and maintaining glycemic control and consequently for reducing diabetes-related complications. A new method that offers us a complete investigation of glucose excursions is continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) that measure glucose concentration in subcutaneous interstitial fluid which can reflect changes in blood glucose concentrations reasonably quickly every 5 min throughout 72 hours (3 days). The aim of this paper was to evaluate the different methods of assessing glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus and to compare themselves in order to establish the clinical relevance. We assessed the glycemic control by HbA1c, SMBG and CGMS Gold simultaneously in a number of 97 individuals with diabetes. 20 individuals have a HbAlc between 6,5 - 7,4\%, 33 patients between 7,5 - 8,4\%, 15 between 8,5-9,4\%, 10 between 9,5 - 10,5\% and 7 persons more than 10,5\%. It was observed that between HbAlc level and the period spent in glycemic values more than 180 mg/di there is not a direct relationship as we expected. The same trend was observed in near normal glycemic status but in different way. Assessing of glycemia in diabetes is crucially important to the prevention of both acute and long - term complications. The 3 fundamental approaches to assessment, HbAlc, SMBG and CGM provide fundamentally different but complementary information.},

Abstract = {There is diabetes mellitus more than 15 million people, and this disease cause various serious complication. Diabetes mellitus therapy is insulin injection therapy, but the quantity of insulin is decided by experience. So it has danger of hypoglycemia attack. Then it is expected for insulin therapy to be done by measuring blood sugar level, but it is not still practical method. We developed that insulin valve system driven by osmotic change (blood sugar level change). This system actuation was confirmed by preliminary experiment. We tried to fabricate the small size valve system which could control micro liter insulin injection. The smaller osmotic valve, the better for a treatment of diabetes mellitus therapy. We tried to confirm that this small valve could control blood sugar level of rat.},

Abstract = {A novel ontology based type 2 diabetes risk analysis system framework is described, which allows the creation of global knowledge representation (ontology) and personalized modeling for a decision support system. A computerized model focusing on organizing knowledge related to three chronic diseases and genes has been developed in an ontological representation that is able to identify interrelationships for the ontology-based personalized risk evaluation for chronic diseases. The personalized modeling is a process of model creation for a single person, based on their personal data and the information available in the ontology. A transductive neuro-fuzzy inference system with weighted data normalization is used to evaluate personalized risk for chronic disease. This approach aims to provide support for further discovery through the integration of the ontological representation to build an expert system in order to pinpoint genes of interest and relevant diet components.},

Abstract = {Background: The suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) provides a link between cytokine action and their negative consequences on insulin signalling. Thus SOCS3 is a potential candidate gene for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on HapMap we identified the polymorphism A+930 -> G (rs4969168) as a haplotype tagging SNP (htSNP) sufficiently covering the genetic variation of the whole gene. We therefore examined the association between rs4969168 within SOCS3 and T2DM in three independent study populations; one prospective case-cohort study and two cross-sectional study populations. Due to the low frequency of individuals being homozygous for the polymorphism a dominant model of inheritance was assumed. The case-cohort study with 2,957 individuals (764 of them with incident T2DM) showed no effect of the polymorphism on diabetes risk (hazard ratio (95\%Cl): 0.86 (0.66-1.13); p = 0.3). Within the MeSyBePo-study population 325 subjects had T2DM from a total of 1,897 individuals, while the second cross-sectional cohort included 851 cases of T2DM within a total of 1653 subjects. According to the results in the prospective study, no association with T2DM was found (odds ratio (95\%Cl): 0.78 (0.54-1.12) for MesyBepo and 1.13 (0.90-1.42) for the Leipzig study population). There was also no association with metabolic subtraits such as insulin sensitivity (p = 0.7), insulin secretion (p = 0.8) or the hyperbolic relation of both, the disposition index (p = 0.7). In addition, no evidence for interaction with BMI or sex was found. We subsequently performed a meta-analysis, additionally including the publicly available data from the T2DM-subcohort of the WTCCC (n = 4,855). The overall odds ratio within that meta-analysis was 0.96 (0.88-1.06). Conclusions/Significance: There is no strong effect of the common genetic variation within the SOCS3 gene on the development of T2DM.},

Abstract = {Background: Despite intensive insulin treatment, many patients with type-1 diabetes (T1DM) have longstanding inadequate glycaemic control. Metformin is an oral hypoglycaemic agent that improves insulin action in patients with type-2 diabetes. We investigated the effect of a one-year treatment with metformin versus placebo in patients with T1DM and persistent poor glycaemic control. Methodology/Principal Findings: One hundred patients with T1DM, preserved hypoglycaemic awareness and HaemoglobinA(1c) (HbA(1c)) >= 8.5\% during the year before enrolment entered a one-month run-in on placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to treatment with either metformin (1 g twice daily) or placebo for 12 months (double-masked). Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and their usual outpatient clinical care. The primary outcome measure was change in HbA(1c) after one year of treatment. At enrolment, mean (standard deviation) HbA(1c) was 9.48\% (0.99) for the metformin group (n=49) and 9.60\% (0.86) for the placebo group (n=51). Mean (95\% confidence interval) baseline-adjusted differences after 12 months with metformin (n=48) versus placebo (n=50) were: HbA(1c), 0.13\% (-0.19; 0.44), p=0.422; Total daily insulin dose, -5.7 U/day (-8.6; -2.9), p < 0.001; body weight, -1.74 kg (-3.32; -0.17), p=0.030. Minor and overall major hypoglycaemia was not significantly different between treatments. Treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions/Significance: In patients with poorly controlled T1DM, adjunct metformin therapy did not provide any improvement of glycaemic control after one year. Nevertheless, adjunct metformin treatment was associated with sustained reductions of insulin dose and body weight. Further investigations into the potential cardiovascular-protective effects of metformin therapy in patients with T1DM are warranted.},

Abstract = {Data can be classified according to their properties. Classification is implemented by developing a model with existing records by using sample data. One of the aims of classification is to increase the reliability of the results obtained from the data. Fuzzy and crisp values are used together in medical data. Regarding to this, a new method is presented for classification of data of a medical database in this study. Also a hybrid neural network that includes artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy neural network (FNN) was developed. Two real-time problem data were investigated for determining the applicability of the proposed method. The data were obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The datasets are Pima Indians diabetes and Cleveland heart disease. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method accuracy, sensitivity and specificity performance measures that are used commonly in medical classification studies were used. The classification accuracies of these datasets were obtained by k-fold cross-validation. The proposed method achieved accuracy values 84.24\% and 86.8\% for Pima Indians diabetes dataset and Cleveland heart disease dataset, respectively. It has been observed that these results are one of the best results compared with results obtained from related previous studies and reported in the UCI web sites.

To address these shortcomings, we developed a diabetes registry population management application to change the way our staff manages patients with diabetes. Use of this new application has helped us coordinate the responsibilities for intervening and monitoring patients in the registry among different users. Our experiences using this combined workflow-informatics intervention system suggest that integrating a chronic disease registry into clinical workflow for the treatment of chronic conditions creates a useful and efficient tool for managing disease.},

Abstract = {Background: Current gene- and cell-based therapies have significant limitations which impede widespread clinical application. Taking diabetes mellitus as a paradigm, we have sought to overcome these limitations by ex vivo electrotransfer of a nonviral insulin expression vector into primary hepatocytes followed by immediate autologous reimplantation in a preclinical model of diabetes. Methods and Results: In a single 3-hour procedure, hepatocytes were isolated from a surgically resected liver wedge, electroporated with an insulin expression plasmid ex vivo and reimplanted intraparenchymally under ultrasonic guidance into the liver in each of 10 streptozotocin-induced diabetic Yorkshire pigs. The vector was comprised of a bifunctional, glucose-responsive promoter linked to human insulin cDNA. Ambient glucose concentrations appropriately altered human insulin mRNA expression and C-peptide secretion within minutes in vitro and in vivo. Treated swine showed correction of hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and other metabolic abnormalities for >= 47 weeks. Metabolic correction correlated significantly with the number of hepatocytes implanted. Importantly, we observed no hypoglycemia even under fasting conditions. Direct intrahepatic implantation of hepatocytes did not alter biochemical indices of liver function or induce abnormal hepatic lobular architecture. About 70\% of implanted hepatocytes functionally engrafted, appeared histologically normal, retained vector DNA and expressed human insulin for >= 47 weeks. Based on structural tissue analyses and transcriptome data, we showed that early correction of diabetes attenuated and even prevented pathological changes in the eye, kidney, liver and aorta. Conclusions: We demonstrate that autologous hepatocytes can be efficiently, simply and safely modified by electroporation of a nonviral vector to express, process and secrete insulin durably. This strategy, which achieved significant and sustained therapeutic efficacy in a large preclinical model without adverse effects, warrants consideration for clinical development especially as it could have broader future applications for the treatment of other acquired and inherited diseases for which systemic reconstitution of a specific protein deficiency is critical.},

Abstract = {Background: The mechanisms underlying the associations between QT interval duration and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain unclear. It has been assumed that these associations are driven by abnormal myocardial repolarization. We examined the relationship between coronary artery disease, measured by coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC), and the duration of QRS, JT, and QT intervals, among predominantly type two diabetic participants. Methods: The study sample included 1,123 subjects from the Diabetes Heart Study, of whom 85\% had type 2 diabetes. Correlations between electrocardiogram interval durations and log-transformed coronary artery calcified (CAC) were assessed in univariate and sequential multivariable generalized estimating equation models adjusted for familial correlations, heart rate, age, race, gender, diabetes status, hypertension status, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, systolic blood pressure, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, QT-prolonging medications, and use of exogenous estrogen. Results: QT interval duration significantly correlated with the extent of CAC in univariate (r = 0.09, P = 0.01) and multivariable models (r = 0.08, P = 0.01). We observed strong correlations between the QRS duration and CAC in univariate (r = 0.23, P < 0.0001) and adjusted models (r = 0.10, P = 0.01). In contrast, the JT interval was not associated with CAC. A strong correlation existed between the QRS interval and CAC in men (QRS: r = 0.24, P <= 0.0001) and diabetics (QRS: r = 0.25, P <= 0.0001) but was absent in women and nondiabetics. These relationships were not modified by CVD, race, or presence of bundle branch block. Conclusion: QT duration correlates with the amount of CAC in a predominantly diabetic population. The association between QT duration and CAC is driven by QRS and not JT interval duration.},

Abstract = {Mathematical models are playing an increasing role in understanding the complexity of multifactorial diseases like type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to validate a population of virtual patients against a real population of patients with type 2 diabetes. A population of virtual patients was created that incorporates different underlying pathogenic lesions consistent with a type 2 diabetic phenotype. These virtual patients were created within the Metabolism PhysioLab platform, a non-linear coupled differential algebraic model that incorporates the salient causal mechanisms underlying glucose homeostasis and substrate metabolism. The weights of each individual virtual patient were determined to reproduce the diversity in a real type 2 diabetic population obtained from the NHANES III study. As a validation test, this virtual population reproduced a series of clinical studies that identify less invasive biomarkers for insulin sensitivity. This approach demonstrates how computational bridges can be constructed between statistical approaches common in epidemiology and deterministic approaches common in biomedical engineering.},

Abstract = {Targeted, tight model-based glycemic control in critical care patients that can reduce mortality 18-45\% is enabled by prediction of insulin sensitivity, S-I. However, this parameter can vary significantly over a given hour in the critically ill as their condition evolves. A stochastic model of S-I variability is constructed using data from 165 critical care patients. Given S-I for an hour, the stochastic model returns the probability density function of S-I for the next hour. Consequently, the glycemic distribution following a known intervention can be derived, enabling pre-determined likelihoods of the result and more accurate control. Cross validation of the S-I variability model shows that 86.6\% of the blood glucose measurements are within the 0.90 probability interval, and 54.0\% are within the interquartile interval. ``Virtual Patients'' with S-I behaving to the overall S-I variability model achieved similar predictive performance in simulated trials (86.8\% and 45.7\%). Finally, adaptive control method incorporating S-I variability is shown to produce improved glycemic control in simulated trials compared to current clinical results. The validated stochastic model and methods provide a platform for developing advanced glycemic control methods addressing critical care variability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; (IDDM) is a chronic disease characterized by the inability of the pancreas to produce sufficient amounts of Insulin. Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4-6 insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy being to maintain normoglycemia-i.e., a blood glucose level between 4-7 mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these Injections, various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a therapy. Here, an attempt Is made to show how system identification and control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be used in design of optimal insulin regimens. The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The Insulin subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several black-box modets and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose Interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed models were able to describe the system accurately In all aspects during all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics. Based on the estimated models, short-term blood glucose predictors for up to two-hour-ahead blood glucose prediction were investigated.},

Abstract = {Using induced L(2)-norm minimization, a robust controller was developed for insulin delivery in Type I diabetic patients. The high-complexity nonlinear diabetic patient Sorensen-model [1] was considered. LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) methodology was used to develop open loop model and robust controller. Considering the normoglycemic set point (81.1 mg/dL), a polytopic set was created over the physiologic boundaries of the glucose-insulin interaction of the Sorensen-model. In this way, LPV model formalism was defined. The robust control was developed considering input and output multiplicative uncertainties with other weighting functions.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach for the simplification of a fuzzy model. Initially, we employ a methodology for the automated generation of fuzzy models based on decision trees. The methodology is realized in three stages. Initially, a crisp model is created from a decision tree, induced from the data. Then, the crisp model it is transformed to a fuzzy one. Finally, in the third stage, all parameters entering the fuzzy model are optimized. The simplification technique is based on the pruning of the initial decision tree. The proposed approach is applied for diabetes diagnosis and the obtained results indicate its efficiency and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to establish the quasi-continuous courses, using microdialysis technique, of glucose, lactate, and glycerol concentrations in interstitial fluid of abdominal adipose tissue during the standard treatment of acute diabetes complications. Clinical studies were carried out on 31 diabetic patients during the initial 48 h of the treatment. In all but two obese female patients with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) did glucose concentration in perfusion fluid (PF) reflect concentration in capillary blood. The recovery of glucose correlated with patients' body mass index (r = 0.55). It was significantly higher in lean and overweight patients (91 +/- 15\%) than in obese patients (55 +/- 31\%). The course of lactate concentration in PF coincided with the course in venous blood (2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, P = 0.35). Glycerol concentration was 267 +/- 41 mu mol/L and 133 +/- 40 mu mol/L in PF and venous blood, respectively (P = 0.004). The study indicated that microdialysis may be an effective tool to monitor concentration of different metabolites in interstitial fluid of the adipose tissue during treatment of the acute complications of diabetes. Applicability of the technique in the monitoring of HHS, especially in obese female patients, needs further investigation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to diagnosis of diabetes disease, which is one of the most important diseases in medical field using Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). Also, we proposed a new cascade learning system based on Generalized Discriminant Analysis and Least Square Support Vector Machine. The proposed system consists of two stages. The first stage, we have used Generalized Discriminant Analysis to discriminant feature variables between healthy and patient (diabetes) data as pre-processing process. The second stage, we have used LS-SVM in order to classification of diabetes dataset. While LS-SVM obtained 78.21\% classification accuracy using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed system called GDA-LS-SVM obtained 82.05\% classification accuracy using 10-fold cross validation. The robustness of the proposed system is examined using classification accuracy, k-fold cross-validation method and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 82.05\% and it is very promising compared to the previously reported classification techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of an early prediction system for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease. It is not only associated with an unhealthy lifestyle but also has a strong genetic component. Accordingly, in order to decrease an incidence rate of T2DM, it is important to predict T2DM risk with using multifactors which are supposed to affect T2DM. We have implemented a prediction system for T2DM, and it employs several statistical prediction models. These models are produced by statistical analysis about cohort data of Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), and include risk factors which are adequate for preventing T2DM in Korean populations. The prediction system is written in JSF and Java, and developed into web application which is designed through object oriented modeling. Web application of this system offers user interfaces in order to input data which is needed for predicting risk group, select predefined prediction models, and so on. The system provides the results which are predicted by selected models using inputted information.},

Abstract = {The etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown, but a growing body of evidence points to infectious agents and/or components of early childhood diet. The National Institutes of Health has established the TEDDY Study consortium of six clinical centers in the United States and Europe and a data coordinating center to identify environmental factors predisposing to, or protective against, islet autoimmunity and T1D. From 20042009, TEDDY will screen more than 360,000 newborns from both the general population and families already affected by T1D to identify an estimated 17,804 children with high-risk HLA-DR, DQ genotypes. Of those, 7,801 (788 first-degree relatives and 7,013 newborns with no family history of T1D) will be enrolled in prospective follow-up beginning before the age of 4.5 months. As of May 2008, TEDDY has screened more than 250,000 newborns and enrolled nearly 5,000 infants-approximately 70\% of the final cohort. Participants are seen every 3 months up to 4 years of age, with subsequent visits every 6 months until the subject is 15 years of age. Blood samples are collected at each visit for detection of candidate infectious agents and nutritional biomarkers; monthly stool samples are collected for infectious agents. These samples are saved in a central repository. Primary endpoints include (1) appearance of one or more islet autoantibodies (to insulin, GAD65 or IA-2) confirmed at two consecutive visits; (2) development of T1D. By age 15, an estimated 800 children will develop islet autoimmunity and 400 will progress to T1D; 67 and 27 children have already reached these endpoints.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the basic biology of diabetes has been guided by observations made using animal models, particularly rodents. However, humans are not mice, and outcomes predicted by murine studies are not always representative of actual outcomes in the clinic. In particular, investigators studying diabetes have relied heavily on mouse and rat models of autoimmune type 1-like diabetes, and experimental results using these models have not been representative of many of the clinical trials in type 1 diabetes. In this article, we describe the availability of new models of humanized mice for the study of three areas of diabetes. These include the use of humanized mice for the study of (1) human islet stem and progenitor cells, (2) human islet allograft rejection, and (3) human immunity and autoimmunity. These humanized mouse models provide an important preclinical bridge between in vitro studies and rodent models and the translation of discoveries in these model systems to the clinic.},

Abstract = {Passive smoking has decreased in recent years (''increased hygiene''). Less environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) gives increased hygiene that, if the hygiene hypothesis is true, in turn might give more autoimmune diseases. The presence of auto antibodies is considered to be an early indicator of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Because tobacco exposure may influence the immune system, we analyzed the relation between passive smoking and development of autoantibodies. A subsample (n = 8794) of the children in the ABIS study was used for this analysis. The parents answered questionnaires on smoking from pregnancy and onwards, and blood samples from the children aged 2.5-3 years were analyzed for GADA and IA-2A. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of GADA or IA-2A (> 95 percentile) between tobacco-exposed and nonexposed children. It was concluded that passive smoking does not seem to influence development of diabetes-related autoantibodies early in life.},

Abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common form of diabetes in children in Western countries. There have been no large studies of childhood diabetes from India. We undertook the MEDI study (Multicenter Survey of Early Onset Diabetes in India) to assess the proportion of various subtypes of diabetes among the young subjects presenting to the endocrinology divisions of seven large teaching hospitals in different regions of India. In addition, we compared the clinical features of T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Indian subjects. Patients with onset of disease at younger than 20 years of age were included in this study. Six hundred and three subjects (603) were studied of whom 535 subjects (89\%) had T1D, 36 (6\%) had T2D, 18 (3\%) had diabetes related to tropical pancreatitis or other forms of chronic pancreatitis, while other subtypes accounted for the rest. Compared to those with T2D, subjects with T1D were younger, had a lower C-peptide level, higher prevalence of ketosis, lower prevalence of acanthosis nigricans, and lower LDL and triglyceride levels. When compared with that of T2D, a higher proportion of patients with T1D were positive for GAD-65 and IA-2 antibodies, and this difference was statistically significant for GAD-65 antibodies. Overall, this large multicenter study showed that T1D is the commonest form of diabetes in childhood. T2D is the next most common kind, while chronic pancreatitis-related diabetes is uncommon.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation in the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene may alter the expression and function of RAGE and affect disease development and outcome. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RAGE were associated with diabetes and parameters of glucose homeostasis. In total, nine SNPs of RAGE were analyzed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes in CODAM: a cohort study of diabetes and atherosclerosis, Maastricht. A significant difference in genotype frequency of SNP rs3134945 was observed between the nondiabetic control subjects, subjects with impaired glucose metabolism, and diabetic patients. The C allele of this polymorphism was significantly associated with higher fasting glucose concentrations, 2-h postload glucose concentrations, insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. These results indicate that SNP rs3134945 or a locus in linkage disequilibrium with this polymorphism may be involved in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Because the functionality of this polymorphism is not known, the mechanism whereby this polymorphism contributes to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes has to be further elucidated.},

Abstract = {Objectives: INCA (Intelligent Control Assistant for Diabetes) is an EU funded project aimed at improving diabetes therapy by creating a personal closed-loop system interacting with telemedical remote control. This study aims at identifying and applying suitable methods for a cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the payor for health services. Methods: For cost analysis MOSAIK-M was used, a method and tool for health information systems analysis and design. Two MOSAIK-M models were created describing conventional insulin pump based diabetes care (CSII), and INCA based diabetes care. Both models were parameterised with costs and simulated to determine yearly costs of diabetes management and treatment for a patient with no diabetes related complications. Probability of developing complications and their duration were determined based on the Archimedes model. It was parameterised with results of a clinical study concerning HbA1c-value changes using the INCA system compared with conventional CSII. The simulation results in form of years of disease within a 30-year time frame were multiplied with corresponding treatment costs. Results: Yearly costs of conventional insulin CSII for a diabetes type 1 patient are D 5908 (German health care system). Using INCA based on the clinical study setting would raise yearly costs by (sic)2233. 24\% of the INCA costs are generated by the continuous blood glucose measurement device, 5\% by IT devices and services. Considering also diabetes related complications in a 30-year time frame and HbA1c value reductions from 7.9 and 7.6\% (conventional CSII) to 7.5 and 7.3\% (INCA) reduces the additional costs of INCA to D 2102 and (sic)2162. Conclusions: The approach produces an estimation of a lower bound for cost savings concerning the treatment of diabetes related complications in a 30-year time frame. These savings alone do not prove cost efficiency of the INCA approach. Further work is needed to improve the approximation and to include indirect and intangible costs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Infiltration of inflammatory cells into pancreatic islets of Langerhans and selective destruction of insulin-secreting beta-cells are characteristics of type 1 diabetes. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial protein expressed in immune cells. UCP2 controls macrophage activation by modulating the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MAPK signaling. We investigated the role of UCP2 on immune cell activity in type 1 diabetes in Ucp2-deficient mice. Using the model of multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, we found that autoimmune diabetes was strongly accelerated in Ucp2-KO mice, compared with Ucp2-WT mice with increased intraislet lymphocytic infiltration. Macrophages from STZ-treated Ucp2-KO mice had increased IL-1 beta and nitric oxide (NO) production, compared with WT macrophages. Moreover, more macrophages were recruited in islets of STZ-treated Ucp2-KO mice, compared with Ucp2-WT mice. This finding also was accompanied by increased NO/ROS-induced damage. Altogether, our data show that inflammation is stronger in Ucp2-KO mice and islets, leading to the exacerbated disease in these mice. Our results highlight the mitochondrial protein UCP2 as a new player in autoimmune diabetes.},

Abstract = {FoxP3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance, and it has been suggested that diabetes-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice are defective in the generation and numbers of Tregs. We found thymic selection of Tregs to be under genetic control. Fetal thymic organ cultures on the NOD background required 3- to 10-fold more antigen than corresponding cultures on the B6 background for optimal induction of Tregs, but once the threshold for induction was reached the NOD background yielded close to 10-fold more Tregs. This increased selection of Tregs was also found in non-transgenic NOD mice in fetal through adult stages. This trait did not map to the MHC, idd3, or the chromosome 3 (Chr3) regions that control clonal deletion, but mainly to two regions on Chr1 and Chr11. Thus, NOD mice do not have a global defect in the generation or maintenance of Tregs; if anything, they show the opposite.},

Abstract = {Over time, most patients with Type 2 diabetes require insulin-replacement therapy to attain and sustain the increasingly stringent glycemic goals. Initiation of subcutaneous insulin may be delayed due to patient or provider resistance. This delay may increase the risk of complications from long-term hyperglycemia. The development of inhaled insulin-delivery systems has been pursued to facilitate earlier initiation and optimization of insulin therapy to achieve better treatment outcomes. The AIR(R) Inhaled Insulin System utilizes relatively large, low-density particles, allowing efficient drug delivery to the deep lung from a simple inhaler. In clinical studies it has provided similar postprandial glycemic control compared with subcutaneously injected, short-acting insulin, and was preferred by more patients. The purpose of this article is to describe the AIR Inhaled Insulin System, provide an overview of other insulin-delivery systems and discuss future strategies for the treatment of diabetes.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a Web-based, p atient- orientated diabetic education management (POEM) system. Methods: The POEM system has been developed to extend hospital patient education by integrating patients' medical care data into their education program components and presenting them on the Web. Since most patients are concerned about their medical care data, the POEM system can provide the incentives for patients to continuously and persistently log in and learn the required knowledge and skills, improving their clinical outcomes. A quasi- experimental method that uses control groups and pretests was used to evaluate the outcomes of the system intervention. We recruited patients with type-2 diabetes and alternatively assigned them to intervention and control groups. We compared laboratory test results including fasting blood glucose, HbAlc, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and HDI. between the two groups from the first visit through each follow-up visit. The study period progressed from September 2003 to May 2004 at the Metabolism Center of a medical teaching hospital in Taipei. Results: In this study, we recruited 274 participants: 134 (S7\% males and 43\% females) in the intervention group and 140 (46\% males and 54\% females) in the control group. The patients' laboratory test results from the first visit for fasting blood glucose, HbAlc, total cholesterol level, TG, and HDL in the intervention and control groups were respec.tively 187.54 +/- 77.10 and 189.99 +/- 73.49 mg/dl, 9.03 +/- 2.79\% and 8.9 +/- 2.23\%, 193.29 +/- 47.93 and 202.52 +/- 58.45mg/dl, 152.48 +/- 70.85 and 157.37 +/- 74.88mg/dI, and 44.97 +/- 12.09 and 45.32 +/- 12.08 mg/dI. There were three follow-up visits during the study period. We collected laboratory test results of the two groups through each of the following visits and analyzed them using ANCOVA. We discovered a significant difference in fasting blood glucose levels between intervention and control group as early as the first follow-up. At the second follow-up, both fasting blood glucose and HBAlc levels were significantly different between intervention and control group. At the third follow-up, there was a significant difference in fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, and total cholesterol between intervention and control group. We also monitored the number of logins for the patients in the intervention group during the follow-up period. The result showed the patients had consistently logged into the POEM system (about 8.5 +/- 3.7 logins per person per month after 3 months enrollment). Thus, the patients in the intervention group had better control of their fasting blood glucose, HbAlc and total cholesterol levels than those in the control group due to the assistance of the system. Conclusions: The POEM system can help patients control their glucose, HbAlc and total cholesterol levels to manage their diabetes, providing an easy and inexpensive way to extend hospital-based patient education services for community-based continuous patient education.},

Abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to insufficient production of insulin(1). A number of genetic determinants of T1D have already been established through candidate gene studies, primarily within the major histocompatibility complex(2-4) but also within other loci(5-12). To identify new genetic factors that increase the risk of T1D, we performed a genome-wide association study in a large paediatric cohort of European descent. In addition to confirming previously identified loci(2-9), we found that T1D was significantly associated with variation within a 233-kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 16p13. This region contains KIAA0350, the gene product of which is predicted to be a sugar-binding, C-type lectin. Three common non-coding variants of the gene (rs2903692, rs725613 and rs17673553) in strong linkage disequilibrium reached genome-wide significance for association with T1D. A subsequent transmission disequilibrium test replication study in an independent cohort confirmed the association. These results indicate that KIAA0350 might be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D and demonstrate the utility of the genome-wide association approach in the identification of previously unsuspected genetic determinants of complex traits.},

Abstract = {Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates that the classic minimal model (MM) and the linear minimal model (LMM) are able to follow the dynamics of glucose in Type I diabetes. LMM precision is better than the MM with systematic lower mean values for the coefficient of variation (CV) in all characteristic model parameters. LMM S-I(L) = 7.40 is not significantly different from MM S-I = 10.71 (units 1/min per mu U/ml, alpha = 0.001) with a strong correlation (R-S = 0.83, alpha = 0.01). LMM S-G(L) = 0.0407 appears to be significantly different to S-G = 0.0266 (units 1/min, alpha = 0.001) but correlates very well (R-S = 0.91, alpha = 0.01). Since residuals appear to be heteroscedastic, further work is required to address the effect of modeling and signal processing on them. For the data under study, the models are not able to fit two-thirds of the data windows available. This is because none of the models are able to follow complex situations such as the presence of several bolus injections, the absence of insulin supply or inappropriate insulin dosage. A synthesis of the patterns found in these windows is presented which would be useful for the development of new models for fitting these data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were hitherto unknown. A systematic search for these variants was recently made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case - control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta-cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in beta-cell development or function (IDE - KIF11 - HHEX and EXT2 - ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits.},

Abstract = {Considering the difficulty in the insulin dosage selection and the problem of hyper- and hypoglycaemia episodes in type 1 diabetes, dosage-aid systems appear as tremendously helpful for these patients. A model-based approach to this problem must unavoidably consider uncertainty sources such as the large intra-patient variability and food intake. This work addresses the prediction of glycaemia for a given insulin therapy face to parametric and input uncertainty, by means of modal interval analysis. As result, a band containing all possible glucose excursions suffered by the patient for the given uncertainty is obtained. From it, a safer prediction of possible hyper- and hypoglycaemia episodes can be calculated.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an Insulin Infusion Advisory System (IIAS) for Type 1 diabetes patients, which use insulin pumps for the Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) is presented. The purpose of the system is to estimate the appropriate insulin infusion rates. The system is based on a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) which uses a hybrid model. The model comprises a Compartmental Model (04), which simulates the absorption of the glucose to the blood due to meal intakes, and a Neural Network (NN), which simulates the glucose-insulin kinetics. The NN is a Recurrent NN (RNN) trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The output of the model consists of short term glucose predictions and provides input to the NMPC, in order for the latter to estimate the optimum insulin infusion rates. For the development and the evaluation of the HAS, data generated from a Mathematical Model (MM) of a Type 1 diabetes patient have been used. The proposed control strategy is evaluated at multiple meal disturbances, various noise levels and additional time delays. The results indicate that the implemented IIAS is capable of handling multiple meals, which correspond to realistic meal profiles, large noise levels and time delays.},

Abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is believed to be an autoimmune disease where cells of the immune system destroy the insulin-producing 0 cells in the islets of Langerhans, The trigger(s) of the inflammatory reaction is yet unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors, including viruses or other pathogens, are thought to play a role. We have recently described a transgenic mouse model-the RIP-CD154 mouse-in which P-cell-specific expression of CD154 (CD40 ligand) mediates immune activation, insulitis, and diabetes on a non-diabetes-prone background. By the use of bone marrow chimeric mice, we now demonstrate that a functional Cd40 gene is necessary for islet inflammation and we show that CD40 expression on bone marrow-derived cells is sufficient to trigger activation of the immune system and development of insulitis.},

Abstract = {Background. Foot ulceration occurs frequently on the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head region, in which the altered foot biomechanics has been mentioned as a contributor. This study attempted to compare the energy dissipation in the plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head between type 2 diabetic patients and age-matched healthy subjects in vivo. Methods. The plantar soft tissues under the metatarsal heads in each left foot of 13 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and eight age-matched healthy subjects were measured with a loading-unloading device. The system comprised a 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer and a load cell that operated at an impact velocity of about 5 cm/s. The stress-strain plot was derived by simultaneously recording the stress response and tissue deformation during a loading-unloading cycle. The energy dissipation ratio in all subjects could then be analyzed. Findings. Although only the plantar soft tissue under the fourth metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endured significantly greater energy (P = 0.035) than the healthy subjects, a trend of an increased energy dissipation ratio for the metatarsals in the diabetic patients was observed. Interpretation. The plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endures high dissipated energy during a simulating walking status in the study. The increased dissipated energy in the tissue may be responsible for the tissue breakdown in the diabetic patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Clinical studies suggest a role for dietary glycemic index (GI) in body weight regulation and diabetes risk. However, partly because manipulation of GI can produce changes in different biochemical parameters and on appetite regulation, its relevance to human health remains controversial. Studies on the effect of low vs. high glycemic index foods on the different metabolism parameters in rats are still not enough. Therefore, in the present study we examined the role of glycemic index and its effect on cholesterol levels in blood and the change in epididymal fat mass in obese rats. We demonstrate that rats on a high glycemic index (HGI) diet have higher plasma cholesterol levels compared with the control group. Moreover, the group on HGI food shows a significant increase in the epididymal fat pad.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the lessons learned front an archetype specification process for the development of a common information model for a Dutch diabetes integrated care protocol. Due to the two-level modelling approach that separates clinical knowledge from information in software systems, archetypes promise to be very well suited for the common definition of health-care information models. Our main observation during our specification process was that archetypes indeed fulfil this promise. However, the different steps to be taken must be supported by a more structured method. That method should include support for proper selection between types of archetypes, such as observation versus evaluation. In addition, the method adopted should support a proper domain and system analysis to derive archetypes from the knowledge base instead of graphical user interfaces. Current and future research work focuses on this method.},

Older, prediabetic NOD mice can rapidly develop T1D following inoculation with CVB, mimicking clinical reports of disease-associated T1D onset. The ability to induce rapid T1D in NOD mice is linked to the rate of replication of the CVB strain in P cell cultures and pancreatic tissue, indicating that any CVB strain is potentially diabetogenic under the correct conditions. Rapid T1D onset is preceded by CVB replication in islet cells including beta cells. Although CVB strains do not productively infect healthy islets of young mice, CVBs can replicate in healthy islets in the presence of murine IL-4. These models expand much of what is known or suspected regarding the etiologic role of HEVs in human T1D.},

Abstract = {Mouse models represent a powerful tool for investigating the underlying mechanisms of disease. Type 1 diabetes results in a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular complications are manifested primarily as ischemic heart disease caused by accelerated atherosclerosis, but also as cardiomyopathy, defined as ventricular dysfunction in the absence of clear ischemic heart disease. Several mouse models are now available to study atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathy associated with type 1 diabetes. For studies of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, these models include low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice in which diabetes is induced by streptozotocin or viral infection. In these mouse models, type I diabetes can be induced without marked changes in plasma lipid levels, thereby mimicking the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, mouse models that exhibit thrombotic events and myocardial infarctions as a result of diabetes still need to be developed. Conversely, cardiomyopathy associated with diabetes has now been extensively evaluated in streptozotocin-treated C57BL/6 mice, and in transgenic mice expressing calmodulin under a beta-cell-specific promoter. These mouse models have given significant insight into the molecular mechanisms causing cardiomyopathy, and indicate that increased oxidative stress contributes to diabetes-associated cardiomyopathy. In this review, we will discuss the available mouse models for studies of cardiovascular complications of type 1 diabetes, the potential mechanisms underlying these complications, and the need for new and improved mouse models.},

Abstract = {Objectives. How accurate can trained clinicians predict blood glucose concentrations? Good clinical treatment is, among other things, related to understanding the factors influencing blood glucose level. We analyze trained clinician's prediction accuracy in comparison with selected computer-implemented prediction algorithms and models. Methods: We have in this study included diaries of 12 people with type 1 diabetes. This test group consists of seven males and five females, ages 24 to 60, HbA(1c) 6.0 to 8.9 and a BMI between 20 and 28 kg/m(2). Eight experienced clinicians tried to predict the blood glucose measurements based on minimum three days of diary history. Selected prediction algorithms and models were used for comparison. The reason we focus on type I diabetes is that it has the most critical insulin requirement, so accurate prediction can be more critical than for type 2. Results: An accuracy of 28.5\% and an error of 26.7\% were found from predictions made by the clinicians. A physiological model and an artificial intelligence model showed higher accuracy of 32.2\% and 34.2\% in comparison with the clinicians (p < 0.05). A simple predictor algorithm based on the mean blood glucose history showed significant (p < 0.05) lower total root mean square error compared to predictions made by the clinicians. Conclusion: To predict blood glucose level from diaries has shown to be profoundly difficult even for experienced clinicians in comparison with predictions from computer algorithms and models. This suggests that computer-based systems incorporating predicting algorithms and models are likely to contribute positively to the day-to-day treatment of people with diabetes.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have an unfavorable prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI), partially due to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). QT dynamicity is an independent predictor of SCD in post-MI patients. However, the effects of diabetes on QT dynamicity in patients with MI have not been described. Methods: We studied 468 survivors of MI (67 with DM) from the population-based MONICA registry (KORA Family Heart Study), Augsburg, Germany, by standardized questionnaire, anthropometry, electrocardiogram (ECG), 30-minute-Holter-ECG-recordings and echocardiography. In addition, 422 siblings without prior MI (22 with DM) were studied by the same protocol. Results: Among post-MI patients, the QT/RR slope was significantly steeper in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.096 +/- 0.057 vs 0.077 +/- 0.045; P = 0.002). Likewise, among siblings without MI, the QT/RR slope was steeper in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.104 +/- 0.053 vs 0.080 +/- 0.042; P = 0.008). The association of DM with steeper QT/RR slope remained significant in multivariate models in post-MI patients (beta: -0.14; P = 0.004) as well as in individuals without MI (beta -0.10; P = 0.047). Conclusions: In a large population of survivors of MI and unaffected siblings, patients and siblings presenting with DM exhibited an abnormal QT rate-dependence, compared with individuals without DM in both groups. Thus, diabetes itself maybe a major determinant of ventricular arrhythmias, independently of a previous MI. These observations might in part explain the higher incidence of sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DM.},

Abstract = {Patients suffer from chronic disease have cost considerable social and medical expanse, it is necessary to provide them with health education both on the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Nowadays, digital learning platform is an excellent channel for convey multimedia enriched content to the people. This research builds a web-based diabetes health education platform and conduct further study on the learner behaviors in this platform. The proposed digital learning platform can log, analyze, predicate, and retrieve the learner behavior. The learner behavior sequence is logged and then analyzed using a sequence learning algorithm. When a new learner enter the platform, it is possible to predict the intention of the learner and thus provide the interested content to him immediately. The proposed architecture had been tested on the diabetes health education for 150 people. The experimental result showed that users were satisfied with the platform and the learning effect improved significantly. With the encouraging results, it will be feasible to apply proposed methodology to other learning courses for a better achievement of popular health.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the medical cost of managing individuals with diabetes has been increased, and it has become one of the socio-national issues. Diabetes self-management includes blood glucose monitoring, physical activity management, nutritional management, and medications for his whole lifetime. And also it needs continuous communication between patient and his doctor for usual life style as well clinical treatment; it's the key to successful self-management of diabetes. We have developed a ubiquitous healthcare system for diabetes self-management, so called ``MDoctor for DM'' in anytime and anywhere manner. This system is effective for managing blood glucose, nutrition, physical activity, and medication using a cellular phone. Blood glucose and physical activity can be monitored by a small device attachable to a cellular phone. The measured data is stored in the cellular phone and transferred to a remote health-log server via wireless internet, finally reviewed by the primary physician of the patient. ``MDoctor for DM'' consists of three subsystem; MDoctor mobile system, MyHealth system, and U-Clinic system. MDoctor mobile system is a mobile device for monitoring bio-signals including blood glucose and physical activity; MyHealth system is a web-based system to store and transfer the monitored data via internet; U-Clinic System enables the primary physician to review the patient's health condition and to support the physician to guide his patient with knowledge-based clinical support system. Physician using the U-Clinic System can provide the self-management supporting service to the patients apart, and the integrated diabetic care based on both in-house clinical data and self-monitored data from the outpatients. ``MDoctor for DM'' is designed to do self-management of blood glucose, physical activity, nutrition, and medication using a cell phone, and this study evaluates this system is efficient to both patients and physicians.},

Abstract = {The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is an important indicator when measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and assessing the burden of disease, especially for chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the scores of HRQOL for respondents with DM to examine associations between overall HUI3 scores and eight component attributes, and various sociodemographic and lifestyle attributes, and by doing so, provide information to improve the HRQOL of individuals with diabetes. The study was based on the Canadian National Population Survey (NPHS) longitudinal data, from 1994-1995 to 2002-2003. We evaluated overall HUI3 scores and eight attributes (vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain) between respondents with and without diabetes in relation to demographic characteristics (age, sex, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status using ANCOVA[analysis of covariance]). Awareness of diabetes appeared to affect the HRQOL of older age groups more so than younger age groups (p < 0.01). Diabetes also appeared to have a greater impact on males' quality of life compared to females', and among individuals with single marital status and low socioeconomic status (p < 0.01). These findings add to what is known about cognitive representations and the self-regulation of diabetes as well as the relationships between cognitive representations of diabetes, HRQOL, and behavioral factors. In particular, results from this study suggest the need to address ways of reducing the burden of diabetes associated with health behaviours, and increasing the quality of life for the individuals with diabetes in Canada.},

Abstract = {Stress-induced hyperglycaemia is prevalent in intensive care, impairing the immune response. Nutritional support regimes with high glucose content further exacerbate the problem. Tight glucose control has been shown to reduce mortality by up to 43\% if levels are kept below 6.1 mmol/L. This research develops a control algorithm with insulin and nutritional inputs for targeted glucose control in the critically ill. Ethics approval for this research was granted by the Canterbury Ethics Committee. Proof-of-concept clinical pilot trials were conducted on intubated, insulin-dependent Christchurch ICU patients (n=7) on constant nutritional support. A target 10-15\% reduction in glucose level per hour for a desired glucose level of 4-6 mmol/L was set. 43\% and 91 \% of glucose targets were achieved within +/- 5 and +/- 20\%, respectively. The mean error was 8.9\% (0.5 mmol/L), with an absolute range [0, 2.9] mmol/L. End glucose levels were 40\% lower compared to initial values. All large target errors are attributable to sudden changes in patient physiology at low glucose values, rather than systemic deficiencies. Target errors are consistent with and explainable by published sensor error distributions. The results show that intensive model-based glucose management with nutrition control reduced absolute glucose levels progressively while reducing the severity of glycaemic fluctuation even with significant inter-patient variability and time-varying physiological condition. Trials spanning longer periods of time are in development to verify the short-term pilot studies performed and to test the adaptability of the controller. Clinically, these results indicate potential in clinical use to reduce ICU mortality as well as reduce risk of severe complications. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress is a key link between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Here, we provide evidence that this mechanistic link can be exploited for therapeutic purposes with orally active chemical chaperones. 4-Phenyl butyric acid and taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid alleviated ER stress in cells and whole animals. Treatment of obese and diabetic mice with these compounds resulted in normalization of hyperglycemia, restoration of systemic insulin sensitivity, resolution of fatty liver disease, and enhancement of insulin action in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Our results demonstrate that chemical chaperones enhance the adaptive capacity of the ER and act as potent antidiabetic modalities with potential application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

Abstract = {An advanced model-based control technique for regulating the blood glucose for patients with Type 1 diabetes is presented. The optimal insulin delivery rate is obtained off-line as an explicit function of the current blood glucose concentration of the patient by using novel parametric programming algorithms, developed at Imperial College London. The implementation of the optimal insulin delivery rate, therefore, requires simple function evaluation and minimal on-line computations. The proposed framework also addresses the uncertainty in the model due to interpatient and intrapatient variability by identifying the model parameters which ensure that a feasible control law can be obtained. The developments reported in this paper are expected to simplify the insulin delivery mechanism, thereby enhancing the quality of life of the patient.},

Abstract = {A wave of apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs normally in pancreatic beta-cclls of newborn mice. We previously showed that macrophages from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice become activated more slowly and engulf apoptotic cells at a lower rate than macrophages from control (Balb/c) mice. It has been hypothesized that this low clearance could result in secondary necrosis, escalating inflammation and self-antigen presentation that later triggers autoimmune, Type 1 diabetes (TID). We here investigate whether this hypothesis could offer a reasonable and parsimonious explanation for onset of T1D in NOD mice. We quantify variants of the Copenhagen model (Freiesleben De Blasio et al. 1999 Diabetes 48, 1677), based on parameters from NOD and Balb/c experimental data. We show that the original Copenhagen model fails to explain observed phenomena within a reasonable range of parameter values, predicting an unrealistic-or-none disease occurrence for both strains. However, if we take into account that, in general, activated macrophages produce harmful cytokines only when engulfing necrotic (but not apoptotic) cells, then the revised model becomes qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable. Further, we show that known differences between NOD and Balb/c mouse macrophage kinetics are large enough to account for the fact that an apoptotic wave can trigger escalating inflammatory response in NOD, but not Balb/c mice. In Balb/c mice, macrophages clear the apoptotic wave so efficiently, that chronic inflammation is prevented.},

Abstract = {We have developed nutritionally induced, insulin-resistant Indian perch, Anabas testudineus, a freshwater teleost which showed all the characteristics found in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to be the major players in implementing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, an epidemic disease threatening global health. Prolong feeding of a FFA, palmitic acid, to perch induced hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, loss of insulin sensitivity and increase in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)). Skeletal muscle cells from FFA-treated perch showed defects in insulin signalling molecules suggesting its link to the impairment of insulin action, a situation similar to that found in insulin-resistant mammalian species and human beings. Results indicate that this nutritionally induced insulin-resistant perch could be a convenient animal model to examine the potential of therapeutic compounds, addressing the problems of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.},

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is one of the top five killer among both man and woman world wide. Type I diabetes is caused by the failure to produce sufficient insulin which leads to an uncontrolled increase in blood glucose. Prolong elevated glucose level of above 150-160mg/dl poses significant health risk with possible long lasting effect. Human assisted insulin injection through compartmental model schedules are basically open loop system. This paper attempts to close the loop by employing model reference adaptive control on a controller to adaptively control the glucose level of the patient via an infusion pump.

Abstract = {There is a significant push to develop closed-loop control systems to deliver insulin for type 1 diabetic subjects. As part of this process, mathematical models are required to test and validate the proposed algorithms. There are several published physiology-based models of glucose and insulin dynamics in the literature, however, all of them were derived using data from subjects without diabetes. For this particular study we have selected one of the recently published models, by Hovorka et al. [1], replacing the subcutaneous insulin infusion model with the one described by Wilinska et al. [2]. Five subjects with type 1 diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a meal challenge and corresponding subcutaneous insulin bolus. The data collected were used to fit the model parameters using global optimization methods. Our results show that the model is capable of describing the observed dynamics for type 1 subjects under the experimental conditions, and as such can be used to simulate subject behavior under the experimental conditions.},

Abstract = {Hyperglycaemia is prevalent in critical care and tight control can reduce mortality from 9-43\% depending on the level of control and the cohort.

This paper evaluates this method in simulation using retrospective data and then compares clinical measurements over 15,000 patient hours to validate the models and development approach. This validation thus also validates the in silica comparison to the landmark clinical tight glycaemic control protocols. Overall, an average clinical glucose level is 5.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, matching simulation, however the overall clinical glucose distribution is slightly tighter than that obtained in simulation, indicating that the retrospective virtual trial design approach is slightly conservative. Finally, the model based approach is shown to have tighter control than existing, more ad-hoc clinical approaches based on the simulation results that qualitatively match reported clinical results, but also show significant variation around the average levels obtained in both the hypo-and hyper- glycaemic ranges.},

Abstract = {In this paper two models for the simulation of glucose-insulin metabolism of children with Type 1 diabetes are presented. The models are based on the combined use of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks (N-Ns). Data from children with Type 1 diabetes, stored in a database, have been used as input to the models. The data are taken from four children with Type 1 diabetes and contain information about glucose levels taken from continuous glucose monitoring system, insulin intake and food intake, along with corresponding time. The influences of taken insulin on plasma insulin concentration, as well as the effect of food intake on glucose input into the blood from the gut, are estimated from the CMs. The outputs of CMs, along with previous glucose measurements, are fed to a NN, which provides short-term prediction of glucose values. For comparative reasons two different NN architectures have been tested: a Feed-Forward NN (FFNN) trained with the back-propagation algorithm with adaptive learning rate and momentum, and a Recurrent NN (RNN), trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTR-L) algorithm. The results indicate that the best prediction performance can be achieved by the use of RNN.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a system developed for monitoring, assisting and educating people with diabetes, named eDiab, is described. A central node (PDA or mobile phone) is used at the patient's side for the transmission of medical information, health advices, alarms, reminders, etc. The software is adapted to blind users by using a screen reader called Mobile Speak Pocket/Phone. The glucose sensor is connected to the central node through wireless links (Zigbee/Bluetooth) and the communication between the central node and the server is established with a GPRS/GSM connection. Finally, a subsystem for health education (which sends medical information and advice like treatment reminder), still under development, is briefly described.},

Abstract = {This paper describes and evaluates a Patient- Oriented education management system for diabetes using the Internet (POEM). With this sYstem ot each patient visit, the system can automatically download a patient's medical services records, prescriptions, laboratory test results and hislher patient education materials, and organize them into a series of case folders based on hislher medical service history in a hospital. Thesystem can also provide patients with reminders to call fior return to their hospitals for further treatment under certain conditions, such as one week before their appointments, the period of their HbA1C test if it is more than three months away, and emergency calls for any anomaly in a laboratoy test result. We present them on the Web to support continued patient education at a low cost. The evaluation results showed that the system was able to help patients maintain better control of their glucose levels and better management of their diabetes condition as well. More importantly, the system supports routine hospital patient education services and assists patients to acquire the diabetes knowledge and skills for self care.},

Abstract = {Although the defects in the sarcolemma (SL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes are known to be associated with cardiac dysfunction in chronic diabetes, very little information regarding the mechanisms of these membrane abnormalities is available in the literature. For this reason, rats were treated daily for 8 weeks with and without enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, 3 days after inducing diabetes with an injection of streptozocin. Treatment of diabetic animals with both enalapril and losartan attenuated alterations in cardiac function and the left ventricular redox potential without any changes in the increased plasma glucose or reduced plasma insulin levels. The SL Na+-K+ ATPase, Ca2+ pump, Na+-dependent Ca2+-uptake, Ca2+-channel density, and low-affinity Ca2+-binding activities were depressed whereas Ca2+ ecto-ATPase activity was increased in the diabetic heart. Furthermore, the SR Ca2+-release and Ca2+-pump activities in the diabetic hearts were decreased without any changes in the Mg2+-ATPase activity. These alterations in SL and SR membranes in diabetic animals were partly prevented by treatments with enalapril and losartan. The results suggest that the activation of the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in diabetes-induced changes in SL and SR membranes as well as cardiac function.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to use prospectively collected data on people with type I diabetes to assess which routinely collected clinical measures predict the development of macrovascular disease in people with type 1 diabetes. Data have been collected in a structured format at an annual review since 1985. For this study, all people with type 1 diabetes in the database in both 1992 and 2001 were ascertained. Data were extracted for a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (macrovascular complications). Presence of other microvascular complications was also ascertained. Forty-one of 404 (10.1\%) people had macrovascular disease at the index visit in 1992 and 61 others developed macrovascular complications during follow-up. People who developed macrovascular complications were older (48 12 versus 36 +/- 11 [SD] years; P = 0.000), had longer duration of diabetes (28 +/- 12 versus 18 +/- 11 years; P = 0.000), higher BMI (26.7 +/- 4.6 versus 25.4 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2); P = 0.041), higher base line serum cholesterol (5.9 +/- 1.7 versus 5.2 +/- 1.1 mmol/L, P = 0.007), higher median base line triglyceride levels (1.5 [IQ range 0.9-2.6] versus 1.1 [0.8-1.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), higher systolic BP (145 +/- 21 versus 129 +/- 20 mmHg; P = 0.000), and higher serum creatinine (102 +/- 57 versus 86 +/- 17 mu mol/L; P = 0.038) than those who did not. We found no significant difference in the base line glycated hemoglobin in the two groups. The multivariate model showed that age, duration of diabetes, systolic BP, and serum cholesterol and creatinine levels predicted the development of macrovascular complications, which were also associated with the later development of microalbuminuria. Macrovascular complications developed in 16.8\% of people with type 1 diabetes over a 9-year follow-up, and were predicted by potentially modifiable factors including higher BP, BMI, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels.},

Abstract = {This article examined the pattern of distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of normal and diabetic Wistar, Zucker lean, and Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats to determine whether there are changes in the number and pattern of distribution of CGRP-positive neurons after the onset of latent or overt diabetes. Type I diabetes mellitus was induced in Wistar rats by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) given intraperitoneally (60 mg/kg body weight). Four weeks after the induction of diabetes mellitus, diabetic (n = 6) and normal (n = 6), Zucker lean (n = 6), and GK (n = 6) rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and their DRGs were removed and processed for immunohistochemistry. CGRP-positive neurons were observed in the DRG of normal and diabetic Wistar, Zucker lean (nondiabetic), and GK (animal model of type 2 diabetes) rats. CGRP was present in small-, medium-, and large-sized neurons of the DRG in these three animal models. Only a small percentage of large-sized neurons contains CGRP. The number of CGRP-positive neurons was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in STZ-induced diabetic Wistar and GK rats compared to normal Wistar and Zucker lean rats. Moreover, the quantity of CGRP-containing varicose nerves was less in diabetic Wistar and GK rats compared to control Wistar and Zucker lean rats. The reduced number of CGRP-positive neurons in the DRG of GK rats indicated that subjects with latent diabetes may already have dysfunctional CGRP metabolism and thus diabetic neuropathy.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article was to use prospectively collected data on people with type I diabetes to examine which routinely collected clinical measures predict the development of peripheral neuropathy in people with type I diabetes. Within the Newcastle Diabetes Services, structured data collection at an annual review has been collected since 1985. This includes metabolic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and markers of complications. From 1990 data collection was standardized and computerized. For this study, all people with type I diabetes in the database in both 1992 and 2001 were ascertained. Data were extracted for a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy (based on neuropathic symptoms, absence of pinprick sensation, and abnormal biothesiometer measurements and/or monofilament sensation) and for the other metabolic and cardiovascular risk measures, as well as markers of other microvascular complications. Associations with the development of neuropathy were sought. Eighteen of 404 people already had peripheral neuropathy in 1992, and 38 others developed neuropathy during follow-up. People who developed neuropathy were older (47 +/- 14 [SD] versus 36 +/- 11 years; P = 0.000), had longer-duration of diabetes (27 13 versus 18 10 years; P = 0.001), higher baseline serum cholesterol (5.8 +/- 1.3 versus 5.2 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, P = 0.017), and higher systolic (139 18 versus 129 20 mmHg; P = 0.003) and diastolic BP ( 2 +/- 12 versus 76 +/- 11 mmHg; P = 0.009) than those who remained free of neuropathy. We found no significant difference for BMI and glycated hemoglobin. The multivariate model showed that diastolic BP, duration of diabetes, serum cholesterol, and history of callus/ulcers on the feet predicted the development of peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy developed in 11.4\% of people with type 1 diabetes over a 9-year follow-up, and was predicted by factors normally associated with cardiovascular rather than microvascular disease.},

Abstract = {Islet autoreactive CD8 T cells are plausible candidates for direct beta cell toxicity in type I diabetes (T1DM). In 2005, cellular studies in the pathogenesis of this disease have reached a new milestone. Autoreactive CD8 T cells have been defined and several target islet epitopes of these have been discovered and validated simultaneously in three independent studies. The insulin B10-B18 peptide that displays exceptional binding affinity for HLA-A2 has been reported in all three studies, and its recognition shows an association with autoimmune beta cell destruction and T1DM. These studies imply that CD8 T cell-based HLA tetramers and ELISPOT analyses can be useful to monitor T1DM as well as islet transplantation, and may provide useful tools to assess immunological efficacy of immune intervention trials.},

Abstract = {Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of beta cells by autoantigen-specific T cells. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, CD8(+) T cells play an essential role in both the initial triggering of insulitis and its destructive phase, and proinsulin (PI) is one of the dominant target antigens (Ags). However, little is known about the beta cell epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules and recognized by human CD8+ T cells. We and other groups recently applied reverse immunology approaches to identify HLA class I-restricted PI epitopes. To establish an inventory of potential naturally processed epitopes, whole human PI or the transitional region between the B-chain and C-peptide were digested with purified proteasome complexes. By combining proteasome digestion data with epitope prediction algorithms, candidate epitopes restricted by HLA-A2.1 and other HLA class I molecules were identified. We validated immunogenicity and natural processing of the identified PI epitopes in HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice, while others demonstrated recognition of multiple PI epitopes by CD8+ T cells from T1DM and healthy subjects in the context of different HLA class I molecules. These results demonstrate the power of reverse immunology strategies for epitope discovery. DNA vaccination of HLA-transgenic mice may be another rapid and efficient reverse immunology approach to map additional epitopes derived from other T1DM Ags, such as IA-2 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65). Transfer of this information to Elispot- and MHC tetramer-based assay formats should allow to reliably detect and characterize autoreactive CD8+ T cell responses in T1DM, and may open new avenues for early T1DM diagnosis and immune intervention.},

In this article we performed the hierarchical clustering of these genes taking into account the human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA)-DRB1/DQB1 profile. The dendrogram obtained using the Cluster program grouped patients and controls into three clusters, one including individuals with no susceptibility alleles, another including individuals with at least three susceptibility alleles, and a third intermingling susceptibility/protective alleles. In addition to other variables, the results of the present article suggest that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II profile may be of relevance for the study of a large-scale differentially expressed genes.},

Abstract = {Mice deficient in programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, Pdcd1), an immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28/cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 family, spontaneously develop lupus-like autoimmune disease and autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy on C57BL/6 and BALB/c backgrounds, respectively. However, how PD-1 deficiency induces different forms of autoimmune diseases on these two strains was unknown. Here, we report that PD-1 deficiency specifically accelerates the onset and frequency of type I diabetes in NOD (nonobese diabetic) mice, with strong T helper 1 polarization of T cells infiltrating into islets. These results suggest that PD-1 deficiency accelerates autoimmune predisposition of the background strain, leading to the induction of different forms of autoimmune diseases depending on the genetic background of the strain. Using NOD-Pdcd1(-/-) mice as an efficient animal model of type I diabetes, we screened diabetes-susceptible loci by genetic linkage analysis. The diabetic incidence of NOD-Pdcd1(-/-) mice was controlled by five genetic loci, including three known recessive loci [Idd (insulin-dependent diabetes) 1, Idd17, and Idd20] and two previously unidentified dominant loci [Iddp (Idd under PD-1 deficiency) 1 and Iddp2].},

Abstract = {The classical minimal model with single compartment was modified by the assumption that the insulin decay rate is not always a first-order process, and a mathematical function for describing the insulin infusion rate is introduced. The modified model was used to study four sets of published data including healthy humans and Type 2 diabetes with different types of insulin infusion rates. The single-step fitting process took the glucose-insulin system as a dynamic integrated physiological system and generated the real optimized model parameters from the experimental data using the modified model. It also avoided the errors from the interpolation or extrapolation for taking measured insulin points as inputs, which were mostly employed in publications when using the single or multi-compartments minimal model. The averaged R-2 value between measured and calculated plasma concentrations for these four cases is 0.977, which indicates excellent agreement. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase isoform (JNK) 1 is implicated in type 2 diabetes. However, a potential role for the JNK2 protein kinase in diabetes has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that JNK2 may play an important role in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes that is caused by autoimmune destruction of \&beta; cells. Studies of nonobese diabetic mice demonstrated that disruption of the Mapk9 gene (which encodes the JNK2 protein kinase) decreased destructive insulitis and reduced disease progression to diabetes. CD4(+) T cells from JNK2-deficient nonobese diabetic mice produced less IFN-\&gamma; but significantly increased amounts of IL-4 and IL-5, indicating polarization toward the Th2 phenotype. This role of JNK2 to control the Th1/Th2 balance of the immune response represents a mechanism of protection against autoimmune diabetes. We conclude that JNK protein kinases may have important roles in diabetes, including functions of JNK1 in type 2 diabetes and JNK2 in type 1 diabetes.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a simulation model of glucose-insulin metabolism for Type 1 diabetes patients is presented. The proposed system is based on the combination of Compartmental Models (CMs) and artificial Neural Networks (NNs). This model alms at the development of an accurate system, in order to assist Type 1 diabetes patients to handle their blood glucose profile and recognize dangerous metabolic states. Data from a Type 1 diabetes patient, stored in a database, have been used as input to the hybrid system. The data contain information about measured blood glucose levels, insulin intake, and description of food intake, along with the corresponding time. The data are passed to three separate CMs, which produce estimations about (i) the effect of Short Acting (SA) insulin intake on blood insulin concentration, (ii) the effect of Intermediate Acting (IA) insulin intake on blood insulin concentration, and (iii) the effect of carbohydrate intake on blood glucose absorption from the gut. The outputs of the three CMs are passed to a Recurrent NN (RNN) in order to predict subsequent blood glucose levels. The RNN is trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The resulted blood glucose predictions are promising for the use of the proposed model for blood glucose level estimation for Type 1 diabetes patients.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is an incurable chronic disease with the prevalence high in developed countries. The number of patients in Korea is also on a steady increase. Patients have to self-manage their blood glucose level by daily test and insulin injection. Therefore, it is very important to assist them in self-management procedure. In this study, PDA(Personal Digital Assistant) based PDMS(Personal Diabetes Management System) was developed in the integrated environment of Visual Studio NET 2003, which consisted of four main menus to manage personal information, diet, exercise, and blood glucose. It gives quantitative health indices, such as BMI(Body Mass Index) and diabetes index, based on personal physical information, pedigree, and living habits. In addition, it is capable of predicting change of the body weight, which may remind patients of the importance of the disease management. The present system can be used as a mobile device within the tele-healthcare system integrated with medical center through internet.},

We implemented a multi-agent system based on CoLe for mining diabetes data, including an agent using a genetic algorithm for mining event sequences, an agent with improvements to the PART algorithm for our problem and a combination agent with methods to produce hybrid rules containing conjunctive and sequence conditions. In our experiments, the CoLe-based system outperformed the individual mining algorithms, with better rules and more rules of a certain quality. From the medical perspective, our system confirmed hypertension has a tight relation to diabetes, and it also suggested connections new to medical doctors.},

Abstract = {We examined the effects of low dose-rate irradiation on the levels of glucose and insulin in the mice. Ten-week-old female type II diabetes model (db) mice were irradiated with gamma-rays at 0.30, 0.70 or 1.2 mGy/h. The level of plasma glucose and the level of plasma insulin was measured. After the irradiation for 24 days, in the control mice, the level of insulin was decreased to 50\% of the initial level, while the decrease was significantly less in the irradiated mice. The mice were irradiated for 2 weeks, and then, after one night fast, they were subjected to a glucose tolerance test. In the irradiated mice, the glucose level was gradually increased. In the non-irradiated mice, the glucose level increased rapidly and the level was kept. These results suggest that the low dose-rate irradiation improved the effectiveness of insulin on the insulin metabolisms and the glucose metabolism in the db mice. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {In the paper an open access internet based computer system has been described, visualizing the patient's postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), determined from an adaptive simulation model of pancreas gland. In the insulin-dependent diabetes, which requires continual insulin dosing, it is necessary to coordinate the meal time with the drug injection. In the insulin-independent diabetes, if it has been diagnosed early enough, a properly composed diet may be a sufficient form of therapy. In both cases the visualization of the plasma glucose level, correlated with the nutrition equivalent of the recent meals, may be helpful in limiting the invasive procedures or assist in proper choice of the diet. At the same time the results of such a simulation may be used by persons fighting obesity, as a direct help in distinguishing between physiological hunger and the abnormal one, resulting from excessive variations of glucose and insulin levels in blood. One of the intermediate goals of the present paper was the introduction of proper modifications to the existing model of the dynamic glucose-insulin dependence, in order to enable the prediction of PPG levels for both healthy and ill persons, based on the last meal time and its nutrition rate determined by the Glycemic Index (GI). Additionally the model has been enhanced to take into account individual parameters (adaptiveness), which may affect the simulation results. A simplified version of the application may be implemented in portable devices like palmtops or mobile phones.},

As a result, the sensitivity of the signaling systems to both hormones and potentiation of their AC effects by guanine nucleotides were markedly decreased compared with that in control group. These functional defects in ACSM may lead to violation of the process of insulin and relaxin signal transduction.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate the efficacy of diabetes-targeted cell therapies in humans, a reliable model in larger animals is highly desirable. This article reports the surgical technique of total pancreatectomy in pigs and the biochemical analysis of the characteristics of totally pancreatectomized pigs. Methods: Surgical total pancreatectomy was conducted in 23 pigs. Blood glucose, insulin, biochemistries, activity index, and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were examined to assess the pathophysiological profiles of diabetic pigs. Results: A total of 14 pigs successfully underwent total pancreatectomy without requiring biliary reconstruction and were analyzed in the present study. Activity index was decreased from day 5 on and the mean survival of totally pancreatectomized pigs was 7.6 +/- 2.7 days. No endogenous insulin secretion was confirmed in these pigs. Pigs which received total pancreatectomy demonstrated significantly higher levels of ketone bodies. IVGTT performed within 4 days after total pancreatectomy showed a spontaneous decrease in blood glucose levels despite an absence of endogenous insulin secretion. IVGTT on day 5 or later showed continued hyperglycemia in pigs with total pancreatectomy. Histological examination showed atrophy of hepatocytes and decreased glycogen storage in the liver and decreased mucus production of the small intestine. Conclusion: This article describes a porcine model of diabetes created by total pancreatectomy and it analyzes the pathophysiological profiles in the animals. The present study has suggested that IVGTT on day 5 or later after total pancreatectomy is a reliable method to evaluate the efficacy of cell therapies.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The web, a widely accessed medium for patients to obtain health information, has special relevance for patients with diabetes. This paper critiques the publicly available web sites for diabetes, and it establishes criteria for excellence in these sites. Methods: A web search for diabetes mellitus based on Google, Yahoo, and the directory Mendosa provided the basis for the study. We defined and evaluated three major categories for each site: usability, content, and reliability. Usability was defined by design, ease of navigation, interactivity, and internal search capability. Content was based on the quality of general information about diabetes, discussions about monitoring blood glucose, meat planning, exercise, complications, medications, alternative therapies, resources, and support systems. Reliability was defined by the presence of the HON code, identification of an author, and the availability of experts. Results: The focused Mendosa search produced 47 web sites. The majority were published by commercial organizations. Five sites were found to have the best usability. Other sites were cluttered or inundated with distracting information from advertisements. Content was generally excellent but limited by an absence of specific advice and information about controlling associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Only 17\% of sites met all criteria for reliability. The sites that best met the criteria for quality were the American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) and the Joslin Diabetes Center (www.joslin.org). Conclusions: Despite the large numbers of publicly available web sites for diabetes, only a few met criteria for quality. The physician's input and ongoing evaluation of these quality measures are essential to assure that patients get meaningful and relevant information from the web about managing diabetes.

Abstract = {A nonlinear model predictive controller has been developed to maintain normoglycemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes during fasting conditions such as during overnight fast. The controller employs a compartment model, which represents the glucoregulatory system and includes submodels representing absorption of subcutaneously administered short-acting insulin Lispro and gut absorption. The controller uses Bayesian parameter estimation to determine time-varying model parameters. Moving target trajectory facilitates slow, controlled normalization of elevated glucose levels and faster normalization of low glucose values. The predictive capabilities of the model have been evaluated using data from 15 clinical experiments in subjects with type 1 diabetes. The experiments employed intravenous glucose sampling (every 15 min) and subcutaneous infusion of insulin Lispro by insulin pump (modified also every 15 min). The model gave glucose predictions with a mean square error proportionally related to the prediction horizon with the value of 0.2 mmol L-1 per 15 min. The assessment of clinical utility of model-based glucose predictions using Clarke error grid analysis gave 95\% of values in zone A and the remaining 5\% of values in zone B for glucose predictions up to 60 min (n = 1674). In conclusion, adaptive nonlinear model predictive control is promising for the control of glucose concentration during fasting conditions in subjects with type 1 diabetes.},

Abstract = {(Prepro)insulin is considered a central antigenic determinant in diabetic autoimmunity. Insulin has been used to modify diabetes development in NOD mice and prediabetic individuals. We have recently shown that (prepro)insulin can adversely promote diabetes development in murine type 1 diabetes. Based on these findings we have developed experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD), a new mouse model characterized by (1) CD4(+)/CD8(+) insulitis, induced by (2) (prepro)insulin DNA vaccination, leading to (3) beta cell damage and insulin deficiency in (4) RIP-B7.1 transgenic mice (H-2b). EAD develops rapidly in 60-95\% of mice after intramuscular, but not intradermal (''gene gun''), vaccination; and DNA plasmids expressing insulin or the insulin analogues glargine, aspart, and lispro are equally potent to induce EAD. Similar to NOD mice, diabetes is adoptively transferred into syngeneic recipients by spleen cell transplantation in a dose-dependent fashion. We have devised a two-stage concept of EAD in which T cell activation and expansion is driven by in vivo autoantigen expression, followed by islet damage that requires beta cell expression of costimulatory B7.1 for disease manifestation. Taken together, EAD is a novel, genetically defined animal model of type 1 diabetes suitable to analyze mechanisms and consequences of insulin-specific T cell autoimmunity.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder which can be greatly affected by lifestyle. The disease cannot be cured but can be controlled, which will minimize the complications such as heart disease, stroke and blindness. Clinicians routinely collect large amounts of information on diabetic patients as part of their day to day management for control of the disease. We investigate the potential for data mining in order to spot trends in the data and attempt to predict outcome. Feature selection has been used to improve the efficiency of the data mining algorithms and identify the contribution of different features to diabetes control status prediction. Decision trees can provide classification accuracy over 78\%. However, while most bad control cases (90\%) can be correctly classified, at least 50\% of good control cases will be misclassified, which means that current feature selection and prediction models illustrate some potential but need additional refinement.},

Abstract = {Diabetes Mellitus represents a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders and its complications are associated with increased morbidity and early mortality. The explosive increase of the number of patients with diabetes, and several recommendations from milestone studies such as the United Kingdom Prospective Study (UKPDS), the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Finnish Prevention Study place further constraint on an already overstretched service. This paper examines the care flow process in the current diabetes management and explores the potential role of new technologies and methodologies currently available to support the highly complex clinical requirements. The paper proposes a concept of e-clinic as an electronic triage system with integrated healthcare record, embedded with a decision support system to analyse patients' data and provide a continuous monitoring system according to agreed clinical guidelines.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is shifting towards a younger age and the incidence rate is rising. Epidemiology studies suggest that a child's risk for disease may correlate with their developmental stage, as the highest incidence rate was observed in the first few years of life, and around puberty. The underlying mechanisms for these observations are still not known. Utilizing a mathematical model of T1DM pathogenesis that we recently developed, we approach this question through the study of the dynamic process of beta-cell destruction. We found that the system dynamic stability of an individual depends on the natural turnover of beta-cell. More active beta-cell mass dynamics will lead to a less stable system against pathological disturbance, and vice versa. Together with the facts that the beta-cell turnover is very rapid during the neonatal age and is elevated again during puberty, and the developmental secular trend in recent decades, our model potentially offers an explanation for the epidemiological observations. We will also discuss the implications of these findings to the genetic and epidemiological study of diabetes, as well as to its prevention and management.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose and either insufficient or ineffective insulin. Blood glucose measurement is crucial to diabetes control, and it is effective in reducing the risk of complications and improving life quality. Unfortunately, both elderly patients and their caregivers find it difficult to monitor glucose levels long term. This study attempts to develop an intelligent maintenance system for home glucose measurement, wireless data transformation, and information analysis. The developed system prompts diabetics to measure their blood glucose regularly at home, and provides remote caregivers with complete patient information for diagnosis and tracking. This aids in the improvement in diabetes control, thereby increasing the social activities and life quality of diabetics.},

Abstract = {The number of patients in Diabetes Mellitus is increasing to eight million in Japan. It is essential to establish the network for homecare of their patients. The diagnostic system for evaluating the degree of diabetes mellitus takes an important role of this network. The blood sugar level is one of the important indexes to measure the degree, which can be described by time series. Chaos Theory is useful to analyze the time series with complex system using the index such as Lyapnov's Index. However, the chaos analyses need a large sample size. The time series of blood sugar has a small sample size less than about 300. We propose a new method to classify the time series with a small sample size. We could characterize the behaviors of chaos and randomness by the probability matrix and proposed a new method to classify the dynamics into chaos or randomness. In this' paper, we analyzed the behaviors of blood sugar levels in diabetes mellitus using the new method. From the results of analysis, it was suggested that the behavior of blood sugar levels of patients could be classify into the chaos type, random type or others.},

Abstract = {Introduction: We have recently shown, in studies with patients with Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes, that alcohol intake at 21:00 h significantly reduced blood glucose values after 10-12 h, compared with control studies with no alcohol. Hypothesis: We hypothesised that this was due to the following effects of alcohol: (1) alcohol metabolism increases NADH, leading to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis; (2) increased glycogen phosphorylase activity depletes hepatic glycogen stores; (3) after the alcohol is metabolised, hepatic insulin sensitivity is increased, leading to the restoration of glycogen stores and reduction in blood glucose Levels; and (4) consequently, after several hours, glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity return to normal. Results: A model describing these changes (DiasNet-Alcohol) was implemented into the DiasNet model of human glucose metabolism. Our study suggests that the DiasNet-Alcohol model gives a reasonable approximation of these effects of alcohol on blood glucose concentration observed in our study and supports our hypothesis for the mechanism behind these effects in Type 1 diabetes.

Abstract = {Type-1 diabetes is a life-long disorder that often occurs in children or young adults. Susceptibility to type-1 diabetes is believed to be dependent on both genetic and environmental causes. Genetic screening is becoming a common tool for evaluating risk, potentially before the onset of the disease. However, interpreting the results of genetic tests involves many rules taken from the literature on the correlation between risk and genetic markers. We introduce an expert system based approach in which the evaluation of risk for type-1 diabetes can be automated. This method can act as a tool for medical professionals and provides the crucial explanatory component, including citations to the relevant literature. The expert system was developed in conjunction with geneticists. As part of the corresponding clinical trial, the expert system correctly identified the at-risk genetic profiles in a set of 253 subjects evaluated by human experts.},

Abstract = {Many diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are concerned about unstable blood glucose, even with regular monitoring by a family doctor. The insulin preparation shows peak action at several hours after subcutaneous administration. For this reason, unstable blood glucose is often caused by intensive insulin therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The insulin requirement is determined in proportion to fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the sliding scale method. A fixed amount of insulin is administered regardless of FBG level in the constant insulin method. It is indispensable to estimate FBG at peak time, A hen insulin works the hardest, to obtain the appropriate effect of insulin administration. We employed the local fuzzy reconstruction method based on chaos theory for predicting FBG at peak time. The direction to change the FBG at peak time is predicted with a 70-90\% success rate. The amount of insulin administration is adjusted based on predicted FBG level. After predictive glycemic control (PGC) for around one year, the FBG average approached the normal range, standard deviation (SD) reduced by half, and hyperglycemia decreased.},

Abstract = {The final common pathway in diabetes development is beta cell apoptosis. We herein describe a novel diabetes model based on transgenic NOD.k iHEL mice, wherein male mice develop diabetes due to nonimmune-mediated beta cell death. Histology and electron microscopy confirm endoplasmic reticulum (ER) abnormalities that are consistent with endoplasmic stress caused by the HEL transgene. The NOD.k MEL model may be particularly useful for studying mechanisms of beta cell death secondary to ER stress and also for testing potential therapies designed to protect beta cells from stress-induced apoptosis. The observation that only male NODA MEL mice develop diabetes and exhibit ER abnormalities is intriguing and suggests these mice may be useful in deciphering the link between hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and diabetes.},

Abstract = {Background-There is controversy about the way the beta cell mass is reduced in type 1 diabetes. One view is that a gradual fall in beta cell mass begins soon after the onset of insulitis. Another view is that a sudden wave of beta cell destruction occurs just before the onset of diabetes. To clarify how the beta cell mass is reduced, we performed adoptive transfer experiments and examined the relationship between the pancreatic status of NOD donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes into NOD-scid recipients. Methods-We killed 18-week-old female NOD mice (n = 20), removed their spleen, and transferred splenocytes into 5-week-old female NOD-scid mice (n = 60). The relationship between the pancreatic status of donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes into recipients was assessed. As pancreatic status, we measured insulin content and severity of insulitis. Results-There was no linear correlation between the pancreatic status of donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes into recipients. NOD donors who needed 7 or more weeks to transfer diabetes in NOD-scid recipients had similar levels of insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of NOD donors who could not transfer diabetes. On the other hand, NOD donors who needed 6 or less weeks to transfer diabetes in recipients had similar levels of insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of diabetic NOD mice. Conclusions-According to our observations, beta cell mass seems to be preserved until just before the onset of diabetes and decreased dramatically within a few weeks.},

Abstract = {In 1996, we designed a randomized multicenter study to assess the effects of small doses of insulin on beta cell failure in slowly progressive type 1 diabetes (the Tokyo Study). W report here the preliminary results of this study. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibody (GADA)-positive patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group received insulin (Ins group), the other a sulfonylurea (SU group). Fifty-four patients (24 Ins group, 30 SU group) were analyzed at the end of a 4-year period. All patients underwent a 75 g oral-glucose test (O-GTT) every 6-12 months. The insulin-dependent stage was defined based on an integrated value of serum C-peptide levels on O-GTT (SigmaCPR; sum of CPR at 0, 30,60,90, and 120 min) below 4.0 ng/mL. The SigmaCPR in the SU group decreased progressively from 22.0 +/- 10.6 to 11.3 +/- 7.5 ng/mL over the 48-month period (p < 0.001 vs. baseline). The SigmaCPR in the Ins group was unchanged. Among the SU group, 30\% of subjects (9/30) progressed to IDDM, while 8.3\% of Ins group subjects (2/24) progressed to IDDM (P = 0.087). With regard to the subjects who had a preserved C-peptide response (SigmaCPR greater than or equal to 10 ng/mL), the proportion of SU group subjects who progressed to IDDM was significantly higher than that of the Ins group (7/28, 25\% vs. 0/21, 0\%, p = 0.015). Among subjects with a high GADA titer (greater than or equal to0 U/mL), 9/14 (64.3\%) of the SU group, but only 2/16 (12.5\%) of the Ins group, developed IDDM (p = 0.0068). As to those with a high GADA titer and a preserved C-peptide response, SU group subjects progressed to IDDM (7/12,58.3\%) more frequently than Ins group subjects (0/14, 0\%) (p = 0.0012). In summary, our results suggest that small doses of insulin effectively prevent beta cell failure in slowly progressive type 1 diabetes. We recommend avoiding SU treatment and instead administering insulin to NIDDM patients with high GADA titer.},

Abstract = {Worldwide nearly 150 million people are suffering from diabetes mellitus. approximately 90 to 95\% of them, i.e. 135 to 142 million are type-2 diabetic patients exhibiting the most important endogenous cardiovascular risk condition. The development of type-2 diabetes is a discontinuous process, featuring interactions between insulin resistance and insulin secretion. In a given case, it has - until now - been impossible neither to predict nor to establish retrospectively whether one of these latter items might have been the primary event or be dominant in the progression of type-2 diabetes. Therefore it is the aim of this study to assess in a given person the developmental stage along the pathway leading towards type-2 diabetes and to quantify the risk of worsening. The underlying rationale is based upon the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes can be modelled mathematically and simulated and thereby be predicted for purposeful intervention to a certain extent.

Abstract = {Recent studies indicated that glucose effectiveness (S-G) is overestimated and insulin sensitivity (S-I) is underestimated with the one-compartment minimal model (1CMM) of glucose kinetics. To correct these errors, Cobelli et al (1999), incorporated a priori knowledge on glucose exchange kinetics using the individual Bayesian estimation to derive S-I and S-G with the 2CMM during standard 1VGTT in healthy subjects. The present study evaluated 2CMM in subjects with type 2 diabetes during insulin-modified 1VGTT and compared its performance with 1CMM, and with the glucose clamp as the gold reference. The 2CMM measured the same S, and SG as the 1CMM and underestimated S, measured by the clamp. For its simplicity and popularity and to benefit from the data available in the literature 1CMM is preferred to 2CMM in type 2 diabetes.},

Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a common and precarious chronic disease, which affects cellular metabolism and energy production. The condition is divided into types I and 11; the most common form is type II diabetes, which is an adult-onset disease. Blood glucose testing is crucial to diabetes control, and it is effective in reducing the risk of complications and improving life quality. Unfortunately, both elderly patients and their caregivers find it difficult to monitor glucose levels long term. This study developed an integrated system for organizing and combining home glucose measurement, data transformation, and information integration. The developed system prompts diabetics to measure their blood glucose regularly at home, and provides remote caregivers with complete patient information for diagnosis and tracking. This aids in the improvement in diabetes control, thereby increasing the social activities and life quality of diabetics.},

Abstract = {We have recently shown, in studies with patients with Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes, that alcohol intake at 2100 hrs significantly reduced blood glucose values after 10-12 hours, compared with control studies with no alcohol. We hypothesised that this was due to the following effects of alcohol: 1. Alcohol metabolism increases NADH, leading to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis; and 2. increased glycogen phosphorylase activity depletes hepatic glycogen stores; 3. After the alcohol is metabolised, hepatic insulin sensitivity is increased, leading to the restoration of glycogen stores and reduction in blood glucose levels, and 4. consequently, after several hours, glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity return to normal. A model describing these changes (DiasNet-Alcohol) was implemented into the DiasNet model of human glucose metabolism. Our study suggests that the DiasNet-Alcohol model gives a reasonable approximation of the effect of alcohol on blood glucose concentration observed in our study and supports our hypothesis for the mechanism behind these effects in Type 1 diabetes.},

Abstract = {The Minimal Model method of determining Insulin Sensitivity from the Intravenous glucose Tolerance Test is a valuable tool for the Diabetes research community. However the Minimal Model algorithm itself is not readily available in a user-friendly modem windows environment to the clinical researcher in many research departments. In addition use of the model often requires intervention by an experienced ``modeller'' to interpret the results produced by the method. This paper proposes a more readily available and usable version of the program and discusses the issues which surround the use of the program by clinical researchers without computer mathematical modelling experience.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients' ability to give valid information of the dietary carbohydrate (CHO) intake and to use the log function of a blood glucose meter for easy transfer of data to a decision support system. 18 Type 1 diabetic patients were enrolled from the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic at the Department of Endocrinology, Aalborg Hospital, Denmark. The patients were divided in subgroups of 4 or 5 patients and was instructed by the dietitian how to estimate the CHO intake and by the doctor in the use of the Accutrend DM(R) blood glucose meter. During a 3 days data collecting period the patients were asked to keep a written diary containing a description of the meals, the estimated CHO intake, the insulin-dosage and the time of the meals and insulin injections, and to make 8-point blood glucose profiles daily. They were furthermore asked to use the log function of the Accutrend DM(R) blood glucose meter. At the second visit the data were discussed individually with the patients and if there where more than three data points missing using the log function the patients were asked to repeat the data collection. A deviation of 10 grams or more, between the patient's and the dietician's estimate, was seen in 7.3\% of the meals following the first instruction, in 1.0\% of the meals following the second instruction, and in 2.4\% of the meals following the third and last instruction. In conclusion, this study showed that Danish Type 1 diabetic patients were able to estimate the dietary carbohydrate content with a high degree of correctness, and to use the log function of the blood glucose meter, after a maximum of 3 hours of training.},

Abstract = {Chronic diseases are a significant burden on western healthcare systems and national economies. It has been suggested that automated disease management for chronic disease, like diabetes mellitus (DM), improves the quality of care and reduces inappropriate utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic measures. We have designed a comprehensive DM Disease Management system for the Negev region in southern Israel. This system takes advantage of currently used clinical and administrative information systems. Algorithms for DM disease management have been created based on existing and accepted Israeli guidelines. All data fields and tables in the source information systems have been analyzed, and interfaces for periodic data loads from these systems have been specified. Based on this data, four subsets of decision support algorithms have been developed. The system generates alerts in these domains to multiple end users. We plan to use the products of this information system analysis and disease management specification in the actual development process of such a system shortly.},

Abstract = {Accumulating data suggest that the gut immune system plays a role in the development of autoimmune diabetes: (1) Diet modifies the incidence of autoimmune diabetes and the phenotype of the islet-infiltrating T cells in the animal models of human type 1 diabetes; (2) gut-associated homing receptor beta7-integrin is found on the islet-infiltrating T cells in both human type 1 diabetes and in the animal models of autoimmune diabetes; (3) mesenterial lymphocytes from young NOD mice are able to transfer diabetes to healthy recipients; (4) autoantigen feeding modifies the disease development in the animal models (prevents or accelerates autoimmune diabetes). In humans, a link between the gut immune system and type 1 diabetes has also been suggested. Early introduction of cow milk formulas in infancy may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes. We have demonstrated that primary immunization to a beta cell-specific autoantigen, insulin, occurs in the gut by exposure to cow milk formulas, which contain immunogenic bovine insulin. The induced antibody and T cell responses to bovine insulin cross-react with human insulin. In children at genetic risk who developed beta cell autoimmunity, bovine insulin-binding antibodies increased during follow-up in contrast to autoantibody-negative children. This suggests that insulin-specific immune response induced by dietary insulin may not be controlled in children prone to beta cell autoimmunity. The gut immune system has a key role in controlling insulin-specific immunity induced by dietary insulin. Indeed, indications for aberrant function of the gut immune system have been reported in type 1 diabetes, such as intestinal immune activation and increased intestinal permeability. Research on the gut immune system in human type 1 diabetes is needed to reveal the role of oral immunity in this disease.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who have serological markers typical of autoimmune type 1 DM. The specific pancreatic markers, ICAs, glutamic decarboxylase (GADAbs), and second islet antigen (IA2Abs), were measured in 70 women with GDM during the pregnancy and after delivery. WAS were measured by indirect immunofluorescence and GADAbs and IA2Abs were determined by a radiobinding assay with recombinant antigens. On entering the study, 1 of 70 (1.4\%) patients was positive for both ICAs (80 JDF-U) and GADAbs (167 U/mL), while another (1.4\%) was positive for WAS (40 JDF-U). None of the patients was positive for IA2Abs. During follow-up, positivity was maintained unchanged in the two positive patients. Four previously negative patients had seroconversion: one for both WAS (20 JDF-U) and GADAbs (49.3 U/mL) and the other three for GADAbs (1.8, 1.4, and 15.3 U/mL, respectively). The IA2Abs remained negative in all patients. Overall, during the observation period 6 of 70 (8.6\%) patients had or developed autoantibodies against endocrine pancreas. During follow-up 15 patients developed clinical DM (10 type 2, 5 type 1) and 7 demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after OGTT. No correlations were demonstrated between the immunological patterns and the evolution in DM. In patients with GDM, the frequency of pancreatic antoantibodies varies during the pregnancy and after delivery, but a small subgroup of patients bearing these markers is identifiable. GDM is a complex syndrome, constituted by different types of diabetes mellitus where the autoimmune form is very rare.},

Abstract = {Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is associated with specific high-risk HLA DQ and DR haplotypes and islet cell antibodies. IDDM susceptibility in Caucasians is more strongly associated with DQ2/DQ8 (DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201/DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302) and DQ6 (B1*0604) than with DRB1*03/DRB1*04, while a single copy of DQ6 (B1*0602) gives sufficient protection against type 1 diabetes. As a part of the ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden) study we have done typing of DQA1, DQB1, and DRB1 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the second exon of the genes, manually dot-blotting onto nylon membranes synthetic sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes, 3'-end-labeling with P-32-dCTP, and hybridization followed by stringency washes and autoradiography using the SSO probe. Among 3756 newborns born in southeast Sweden we have found the high-risk genotype DQ2/DR3-DO8/DR4 to be present in 1\%, haplotype DQ8/DR4 in 7.8\%, and haplotype DQ2JDR3 in 9.6\%. DQ2/DR3 or DQ8/DR4 was carried by 16.4\% of newborns; the low-risk DQ6 molecule was carried by newborns as follows: DQ2/DR3-DQ6/DR15, 1.3\%; DQ8/DR4-DQ6/DR15, 1.3\%; and DQ6/DR15, 9.4\%. We conclude from our results that the high incidence of IDDM in Sweden is at least in part due to increased prevalence of high-risk HLA haplotypes compared to protective haplotypes (20\% vs. 13\%) in the general population.},

Abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is positively associated with HLA-DQ8, DQ2, and DQ6 (B*0604) and negatively with DQ6 (B*0602). The mechanisms by which the DQ molecules control the development of IDDM is not known. DQ6 (B*0602) and DQ6 (B*0604) molecules share the same DQalpha chain but differ in the beta chain by six residues at positions 9, 30, 57, 70, 86, and 87. The aim of the study was to sequence the peptides eluted from both DQ6 molecules and to determine the binding motifs and construct peptides for docking them into the DQ6 peptide binding groove by molecular modeling. EBV transformed B cell line homozygous for DQ6 and hybridoma cell line secreting DQ6 specific antibody were grown in large-scale culture. The DQ6 molecules were precipitated with solid-phase bound antibodies specific for DQ6. The dissociation of peptides from MHC was done with ultrafiltration and separation of peptides by reversed-phase HPLC, using Edman degradation. A special application of Edman degradation is pool sequencing. This approach allowed us to determine common characteristics of all peptides associated with a given MHC molecule. The precipitation of DQ6 molecules and the peptide elution were done successfully. The sequencing of the peptides from DQ6 (B*0602) identified three fractions: (1) IINEPTAAAIAYGLD (Bovine HSP70), (2) IINEPTAAAIAGLDR (Human HSP70), and (3) NPRDAKACVVHGSDLK (Na+/K+ ATPase). Peptide eluted from DQ6 (B*0604) had a sequence ADLFRGTLDPVEK with sequence homology to HSP70 (residues 307-319). We were able to predict the motifs for DQ6 from the ligands eluted. We used molecular modeling as a tool to identify plausible binding motifs for peptides. Our studies show that peptide ADLFRGTLDPVEK and NPRDAKACVVHGSDLK fit well in the respective DQ6 binding grooves. These predicted motifs should then be useful for screening of autoantigens associated with diabetes and identifying the epitopes that are likely to interact with T cells.},

Abstract = {Blood cells from subjects with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus have been successfully studied in the past to gain insight into pathological alterations of several signal transduction pathways. Diabetes mellitus is also considered to be a disease of abnormal cellular Ca2+ metabolism, as metabolic derangements of Ca2+, transport have been noticed both in the prediabetic state and as a consequence of hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. In this report, we used peripheral blood lymphocytes from type 2 diabetes patients and control subjects to study and delineate different mechanisms of Ca2+ turnover that determine the level of cytosolic calcium (Ca-i). While demonstrating the specific Ca2+ turnover alterations, we suggest that insights into the pathophysiology of diabetic complications originating from signal transduction defects could be conveniently studied using blood cell types such as lymphocytes and that such studies could lead to the identification of new molecular drug targets.},

Heart disease in IDDM patients was found to constitute a separate entity, termed diabetic cardiomyopathy. All IDDM patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction had evidence of autonomic neuropathy. However, there was no correlation with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Abstract = {While it is certain from the analysis of transgenic models of lipodystrophy that a critical mass of adipose tissue is necessary to prevent the development of diabetes, the reasons why diabetes develops in one obese individual and not in another need to be further investigated. This is also one of the major questions associated with the current obesity epidemic and the development of the metabolic syndrome. The severe lipodystrophic models do not really address this big problem. In this presentation, we point out that models exist among inbred strains of mice that can contribute towards finding answers to the diabetes found in the metabolic syndrome. The differences responsible for the phenotypic variations are undoubtedly multifactorial and involve many genes, but there are powerful genetic resources to investigate these problems.},

Abstract = {DNA-based approaches to the discovery of genes contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes have not been very successful despite substantial investments of time and money. The multiple gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that influence the development of type 2 diabetes mean that DNA approaches are not the ideal tool for defining the etiology of this complex disease. Gene expression-based technologies may prove to be a more rewarding strategy to identify diabetes candidate genes. There are a number of RNA-based technologies available to identify genes that are differentially expressed in various tissues in type 2 diabetes. These include differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and cDNA microarrays. The power of new technologies to detect differential gene expression is ideally suited to studies utilizing appropriate animal models of human disease. We have shown that the gene expression approach, in combination with an excellent animal model such as the Israeli sand rat (Psammomys obesus), can provide novel genes and pathways that may be important in the disease process and provide novel therapeutic approaches. This paper will describe a new gene discovery, beacon, a novel gene linked with energy intake. As the functional characterization of novel genes discovered in our laboratory using this approach continues, it is anticipated that we will soon be able to compile a definitive list of genes that are important in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes.},

Abstract = {The relationship between interstitial glucose (IG) and plasma glucose (PG) is not fully understood. We investigated this relationship during physiological conditions in subjects with type I diabetes. Nine subjects were studied over 12h. IG was measured every 30 and PG every 15min. Nine alternative compartment models were formulated assessing one or more effects including insulin and saturability effects. Model parameters were estimated from IG using PG as forcing function. Acceptable precision (CV<100\%) was achieved for most parameter estimates. Model selection process was based on Akaike criterion. The model which best explained the experimental data included both the effect of insulin on glucose transfer from plasma to interstitial fluid (IF) and the presence of zero-order removal of glucose from IF.},

Abstract = {Intensive diabetes treatment can lead to a substantial reduction of the rate of the complications associated with diabetes. However, a number of patients may have poor control despite specialist care, and this along with devolution of care to non-specialists suggests that alternative interventions should be developed. The present paper describes an Internet based system where more emphasis is put on patient empowerment, the keywords being education and communication. The DiasNet system is based on a well documented decision support system, Dias, designed for use by clinicians. The scope of DiasNet has been widened from being used by clinicians to give advice on insulin dose, to also being used by patients as a tool for education and communication. Patients can experiment with their own data, adjusting insulin doses or meal sizes. In this way different therapeutic and dietary alternatives can be tried out, allowing the patient to gain experience in achieving glycaemic control. DiasNet is implemented in JAVA according to the client/server principle, enabling a new way of communication between patient and clinician: in case of any problems, the patient simply phones the clinician, who immediately, using his or her office PC, can take a look at the data the patient has entered.

Abstract = {This paper presents a neural network (NN) model to evaluate an existing Health Risk Appraisal (HRA)(2) for diabetes prediction over 3 years (1996-1998) based on a simulated learning algorithm on individual prognostic process, using the repeatedly measured HRAs of 6142 participants. The approach uses a sequential multi-layered perceptron (SMLP) with backpropagation learning, and an explicit model of time-varying inputs along with the sequentially obtained prediction probability, which was obtained by embedding a multivariate logistic function for consecutive years. The study captures the time-sensitive feature of associating risk factors as predictors to the occurrence of diabetes in the corresponding period. This approach outperforms the baseline classification and regression models in terms of gains (average profit: 0.18) and sensitivity (86.04\%) for a test data. The result enables a time-sensitive disease prevention and management program as a prospective effort. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nine type 1 diabetic patients were studied for 24 hours. During this period they were given three calibrated meals. The glycemia was feedback-controlled by means of an artificial pancreas. The blood concentration of glucose and the infusion speed of the insulin were measured every minute. The experimental data referring to each of the three meals were used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model suitable for describing the glycemic response of diabetic patients at meals and at the i.v. infusion of exogenous insulin. From the estimate a marked dispersion of the parameters was found, both interindividual and intraindividual. Nevertheless the models thus obtained seem to be usable for the synthesis of a feedback controller, especially in view of creating a portable artificial pancreas that now seems possible owing to the realization (so far experimental) of sufficiently reliable glucose concentration sensors.},

Abstract = {There are two regulations in diabetes physiology using perhaps the rapid derivative regulator: Early phase of insulin secretion in intravenous glucose tolerance test and hormone reaction to hypoglycemia. We have found another rapid insulin dependent regulation of ketone (betahyroxybutyrate- BOH) forming. The modelling of BOH forming is determined by following parameters: nitrogen balance, glucose and insulin change during weight reduction. Early ketone bodies forming in obesity is an example of dual reaction. The first phase of ketone bodies response is a quick reaction to insulin level decrease. The second phase forms a plateau with steady state of betahydroxybutyrate forming and metabolic extraction. A model with derivative regulator should be used for modelling of ketone forming in obesity and diabetes.},

Abstract = {A cure for diabetes has long been sought using several different approaches, including islet transplantation, regeneration of beta cells and insulin gene therapy(1). However, permanent remission of type 1 diabetes has not yet been satisfactorily achieved. The development of type 1 diabetes results from the almost total destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells by autoimmune responses specific to beta cells(2-6). Standard insulin therapy may not maintain blood glucose concentrations within the relatively narrow range that occurs in the presence of normal pancreatic beta cells(7). We used a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) that expresses a single-chain insulin analogue (SIA), which possesses biologically active insulin activity without enzymatic conversion, under the control of hepatocyte-specific L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoter, which regulates SIA expression in response to blood glucose levels. Here we show that SIA produced from the gene construct rAAV-LPK-SIA caused remission of diabetes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and autoimmune diabetic mice for a prolonged time without any apparent side effects. This new SIA gene therapy may have potential therapeutic value for the cure of autoimmune diabetes in humans.},

Abstract = {DIABNET is a knowledge-based system designed to aid doctors with therapy planning in gestational diabetes. The system core is a qualitative model, implemented by a Causal Probabilistic Network, that is able to detect the insulin effectiveness on a daily basis. DIABNET analyses monitoring data and proposes quantitative changes in insulin therapy and qualitative diet modifications. This paper proposes an evaluation methodology to assess the system performance when working in a real scenario. The methodology manages the absence of a gold standard and includes. a subjective analysis based on questionnaires and an objective analysis based on a quantitative comparison of the system's and experts' proposals. The paper also shows the results of two experiments in which expert diabetologists evaluated the therapeutical advice provided by DIABNET during the follow up of 9 patients with gestational diabetes. DIABNET detected the need of a therapy modification in 92\% of the cases showing its appropriateness for automatic alarm generation. Around 80\% of the proposals were accepted by experts. The evaluation results are encouraging and allow characterisation of the system's performance when proposing therapy modifications. Evaluation in its turn helps to refine the knowledge managed by DIABNET and enables us to look towards the further clinical use of DIABNET as a decision tool in gestational diabetes integrated in a telemedicine service.

We have created a diabetes health record system based on the Good European Health Record (GEHR). Diabetes has served as a prototype for development of a model for chronic illness care. This Architecture provides a common data structure for electronic health care records, taking into account ethical, legal, security, and educational requirements. A wide range of data types (including laboratory data, photographs, bio-signals, etc.), created in many sources can be recorded The system offers support for the process of clinical care and medical education. The BSTD system was developed using a modular design and object oriented method approach. The Patient Records Function offers options for the management of the EHCRs (creation/correction/visualization), such as registration of a new patient and recording of his first Basic Information Sheet; the recording of a new sheet; the correction/visualization of the sheet; the recording of data about the patient's death, etc. The System Administration Function allows: the definition of the health care facility; the management of persons that use the system or fills in the sheets; the management of passwords and access rights for the users; the management of units used for measurements; the management of the interface of the system. The system is currently undergoing formal clinical evaluation in diabetes centers from Romania, Ukraine and Moldavia.},

Abstract = {This study concerns whether advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) are related to microvascular derangement in diabetes, exemplified by pericyte loss and angiogenesis in retinopathy and by mesangial expansion in nephropathy, AGE caused a decrease in viable pericytes cultivated from bovine retina. On the other hand, AGE stimulated the growth and tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells (EC), this being mediated by autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor. In AGE-exposed rat mesangial cells, type TV collagen synthesis was induced, Those AGE actions were dependent on a cell surface receptor for AGE (RAGE), because they were abolished by RAGE antisense or ribozyme, The AGE-RAGE system may thus participate in the development of diabetic microangiopathy. This proposition was supported by experiments with animal models; several indices characteristic of retinopathy were correlated with circulating AGE levels in OLETF rats. The predisposition to nephropathy was augmented in RAGE transgenic mice when they became diabetic.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases and it often leads to a substantial loss of quality of life. However, complications can be relieved by intensive insulin treatment, which, unfortunately, also increases the frequency severe hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), In 1959 Somogyi described how insulin overtreatment, leading to hypoglycaemia, can cause prolonged hyperglycaemia (elevated blood glucose), but numerous studies, especially in the 80ies, have not been able to produce significant evidence for his theory, However, in a recent model-based study we have introduced a hypothesis suggesting that the phenomenon is clinically much more important than previously anticipated. The present pilot study assesses the feasibility of employing a computer model to data from a 32 hour intensive monitoring period from 3 patients to infer the reaction to spontaneous hypoglycaemia, thereby contributing to the verification of the hypothesis and to an understanding of the phenomenon. Regarded separately, the number of patients in the present study is far to small to justify any conclusion, but, taken together with our previous studies, there seems to be substantial evidence for the existence of the hypoglycaemic counter-regulation. Furthermore, the present study seems to suggest that cortisol release, triggered by the hypoglycaemic attack, may play an important role in provoking the hypoglycaemic counter-regulation, and that further studies are clearly required to verify this hypothesis.},
